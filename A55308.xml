            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
            <p>IT was anciently obſerved by St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> touching the Prophets under the <hi>Old Teſtament, Non tantum lingua illorum hominum, verum etiam vita fuit Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetica:</hi> They did not only propheſie, or reveal the mind of God by words; but by things done by or upon them. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> muſt walk naked and barefoot, to ſhew the ſhame of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> captivity. <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> muſt go down to the Potters Houſe, and there ſee the Veſſel marred, to give the <hi>Jews</hi> a pregnant demonſtration, that God could unmake and deſtroy them. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to remove and bring forth his ſtuff, to give them a lively repreſentation of their captivity. Above all, this was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently ſeen in our great Prophet Jeſus Chriſt; He did not only reveal the Goſpel, but he himſelf is the ſubſtance and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb facs="tcp:60626:3"/>of it. He is the very mirror of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths and Perfections. His ſtile is the Image of the inviſible God, the brightneſs of the Fathers Glory. As an eternal Son, he is ſuch in himſelf; As incarnate, he is ſuch to us. The Meſſiah (ſay the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi>) is <hi>facies Dei,</hi> the face of God. <hi>The Glory of God</hi> (faith the Apoſtle) <hi>is in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Divine perfections appear in him, as beauty doth in the face. The inviſible one may here be ſeen; the inacceſſible Majeſty may be approach'd unto. Infinity, to accommodate it ſelf to our Model, appears <hi>nube carnis,</hi> in a Cloud of fleſh, that his glory might not ſwallow us up. In our <hi>Emanuel</hi> we have a body of Theology, an excellent Summary of Divine Truths, in a very lively manner ſet forth to us. The Atheiſt, who owns not a God in Heaven, might here, if he had eyes of Faith, ſee God in the fleſh. The Wiſdom of God doth here appear, not in the orders and harmonies of nature; but in a plot much greater, and more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable: God and Man, infinite and finite, Eternal and Temporal are met in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:60626:3"/>that the human, finite, temporal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Chriſt, might be the Theater for the Divine, Infinite, Eternal nature to ſhew its perfections in. The Truth of God manifeſts it ſelf illuſtriouſly, in that no difficulty could hinder the early promiſe of the Meſſiah made immediately after the fall of man; neither could any time bury it in oblivion. He would be true in that which was the hardeſt thing for him to do, in parting with his only begotten out of his boſom for us. After many ages the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe muſt bud and bloſſom, and bring forth the Meſſiah. We ſee here, That God is the holy one, his hatred of ſin is writ in Red Characters, in the blood and wounds of our dear Lord. His love to holineſs was ſuch, that he would ſend his own Son in the fleſh, to recover holineſs into the heart of man again. We have here Providence accurately watching over our Saviour all-along; firſt over his Genealogy, then over his birth, life, death, reſurrection: And laſtly over the iſſue of all; a Church raiſed up to ſing Hoſannah's to him for ever. <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia plena Sacramentorum,</hi> ſaith an Ancient;
<pb facs="tcp:60626:4"/>Every thing in Chriſt reads us a Lecture of Divinity. He being the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who brought in righteouſneſs and life unto men; we are ſure that there was a firſt, who brought in ſin and death to them. From his conception, being an extraordinary one, we may plainly gather what the Two ſtates of Nature and Grace are; By the common generation we are fleſh of fleſh, unclean creatures. By the power of the regenerating ſpirit overſhadowing our hearts, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſpirit of ſpirit, holy new-creatures. In his life and preaching we have miracles triumphing over nature and all the order of it; Myſteries exceeding Reaſon, and all its <hi>Acumen;</hi> and a Samplar of humility, Meekneſs, Mercy, Righteouſneſs, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Obedience, ſuch as the Sun never ſaw. In his death we have, what the proud <hi>Socinian</hi> thinks impoſſible, Infinite Mercy, and Infinite Juſtice kiſſing and embracing each other. Mercy was ſeen, that God ſhould give his only, his dearly beloved Son for us. Juſtice was ſeen, that God ſhould exact of him, ſtanding in our ſtead, as much as would counterpoize the ſin and
<pb facs="tcp:60626:4"/>ſuffering of a World, in his glorious ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. We ſee what that is, which juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ſinners, and makes them ſtand before the Holy God. In his excellent example, we ſee how juſtified ones, which are my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical parts and pieces of him, ought to walk and tread in his ſteps. Theſe things are the ſubject matter of the enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; may all, who are called Chriſtians, ſtudy Jeſus Chriſt. The little <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Reaſon of Man, is much cried up in this Age; may we much more adore the Infinite Word and Wiſdom of God. The temper of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> may be recommended to all, <hi>Si ſcribas, non ſapit mihi, niſi legero ibi Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum; ſi diſputes aut conferas, non ſapit mihi, niſi ſonuerit ibi Jeſus:</hi> The devout Father could not reliſh any thing but Jeſus Chriſt; may our hearts ever burn and be inflamed with love to him, in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg; may we deſire none but Chriſt: <hi>Non aliud praeter illum, non aliud tanquam illum, non aliud poſt illum;</hi> Nothing beſides him, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like him, nothing after him. This
<pb facs="tcp:60626:5"/>is the ſcope of my Book; if it profit or do good to any, it is enough, and as much as is deſired by him, who is</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD All-ſufficient muſt needs be his own happineſs; he hath his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from himſelf, and his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is no other than his being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant with all Excellencies, and by intellectual and amatorious refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions, turning back into the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it ſelf. His Underſtanding hath proſpect enough in his own infinite Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: his Will hath reſt enough in his own infinite Goodneſs; he needed not the pleaſure of a World, who hath an eternal Son in his boſom to joy in; nor the breath of Angels or men, who hath an eternal Spirit of his own: he is the Great All, comprizing all within himſelf: nay, unleſs he were ſo, he could not be God. Had he let out no beams of his glory, or made no intelligent creatures to gather up and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them back to himſelf, his happineſs would have ſuffered no eclipſe or diminution at all: his Power would have been the ſame, if it had folded up all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60626:9"/>the poſſible Worlds within its own arms, and poured forth never an one into being to be a monument of it ſelf. His Wiſdom the ſame, if it had kept in all the orders and infinite harmonies lying in its boſom, and ſet forth no ſuch ſeries and curious contexture of things as now are before our eyes. His Goodneſs might have kept an eternal Sabbath in it ſelf, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have come forth in thoſe drops and models of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which make up the Creation. His Eternity ſtood not in need of any ſuch thing as time or a ſucceſſion of inſtants to meaſure its duration; nor his Immenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any ſuch Temple as Heaven and Earth to dwell in, and fill with his preſence. His Holineſs wanted not ſuch pictures of it ſelf as are in Laws or Saints; nor his Grace ſuch a channel to run in as Covenants or Promiſes. His Majeſty would have made no abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it had had no train or hoſt of creatures to wait upon it, or no rational ones among them, ſuch as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men, to ſound forth its praiſes in the upper or lower World. Creature-praiſes, though in the higheſt tune of Angels, are but as ſilence to him, as that Text may be read, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 65.1. Were he to be ſerved according to his Greatneſs, all the men in the World would not be enough to make a Prieſt, nor all the other creatures enough to make a Sacrifice fit for him; <hi>Is it any pleaſure to him that thou art righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> Job 22.3? No doubt he takes pleaſure in our righteouſneſs, but the complacence is without indigence; and while he likes it, he wants it not.</p>
               <p>That ſuch an infinite All-ſufficient One ſhould mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf, muſt needs be an act of admirable ſuperefflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Goodneſs; ſuch as indeed could not be done without ſtooping down below his own Infinity, that he might
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60626:9"/>gratifie our weakneſs. Thoſe two Hebrew words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which imports fleſh or weakneſs, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is to annunciate and declare good tidings, are of a neer affinity. In the myſterie of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion God came down into our fleſh; and in every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſtation of himſelf, he comes down, as it were, into the weakneſs of creatures or notions, that we, who cannot hear or underſtand the eternal Word in it ſelf, or enter the Light inacceſſible, might ſee him in reflexes and finite glaſſes, ſuch as we are able to bear. Every manifeſtation imports conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion. The World, as fair and goodly a ſtructure as it is, is but <hi>inſtar puncti aut nihili,</hi> like a little drop or ſmall duſt to him. Creature-reaſon, though a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine particle, and more glorious than the Sun it ſelf, is but a little ſpark for the Infinite Light to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in. No words, no not thoſe in the pureſt Laws and richeſt Promiſes, are able to reach him; who, as an Ancient hath it, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Eſſence, Goodneſs, Wiſdom, all in hyperbole, in a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent exceſs above words or notions. His Name is above every name; nevertheleſs, he humbles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to appear to our minds in a Scripture-image; nay, to our very ſenſes in the body of Nature, that we might claſp the arms of Faith and Love about the holy beams, and in their light and warmth aſcend up to their great Original, the Father of Lights and Mercies.</p>
               <p>God hath manifeſted himſelf many ways. He ſet up the material World, that he, though an inviſible Spirit, might render himſelf viſible therein: all the hoſts of Creatures wear his colours. Senſible things (ſay the <hi>Platoniſts</hi>) are but the types and reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſpiritual, which are the primitive and arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>typal
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60626:10"/>Beings. Every thing here below (ſay the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cabaliſts) hath ſome root above, and all Worlds have the print and ſeal of God upon them. Eternity ſhadows forth it ſelf in time; infinite Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, pourtray out themſelves upon finite things in ſuch legible characters, that, as ſoon as we open our eyes upon them, we ſee innumerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures pointing to the Creator, and teaching that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which <hi>Archytas</hi> the Philoſopher placed in the reduction of all things to one great Original. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power hath printed it ſelf upon the World, nay, upon every little particle of it: all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures came out of nothing, and between that and Being is a very vaſt gulf. It was an infinite Power, which filled it up and fetched over the creatures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Being; it was an Almighty Word, which made the creatures at an infinite diſtance hear and riſe up out of nothing. The old Axiom, <hi>Ex nihilo nihil ſit,</hi> is Natures limit and a true meaſure of finite powers; but when, as in the Creation, Nature overflows the banks, when Nullity it ſelf ſprings up and runs over into a World, we are ſure, that the moving Power was an Infinite one. And as infinite Power appears in the being of the creatures, ſo doth infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in their orders and harmonies. The curious I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's and Congruities, which before were latent in the divine breaſt, are limned out upon outward and ſenſible things, ſtanding in delicate order and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion before our eyes. The World is a Syſtem of contraries made up into one body, in which diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natures conſpire together for the common good: each creature keeps its ſtation, and all the parts of Nature hang one upon another in a ſweet confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. Meer natural Agents operate towards their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60626:10"/>ends, as if they were Maſters of Reaſon, and hit their proper mark, as if they had a providence within them. Such things as theſe teach us to conclude with <hi>Zeno,</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Reaſon, is the Great Artiſt which made all; and to break out with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>O Lord! how manifold are thy works? in wiſdom haſt thou made them all.</hi> And as the two former Attributes ſhew forth themſelves in the creatures, ſo alſo doth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodneſs: all the drops and meaſures of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the creature lead us to that infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is the Fountain and Spring of all. <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recydes</hi> the Philoſopher ſaid, That <hi>Jupiter</hi> firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himſelf into Love, and then made the World; he, who is eſſential Love, ſo framed it, that Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appears every-where: it ſhines in the Sun, breathes in the Air, flows in the Sea, and ſprings in the Earth; it is Reaſon in Men, ſenſe in Brutes, life in Plants, and more than meer Being in the leaſt particles of matter. The <hi>Manichees,</hi> who would have had their Name from pouring out of <hi>Manna,</hi> did brook their true name from <hi>Mania,</hi> that is, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in denying ſo excellent a World to be from the good God. The light in their Eyes, breath in their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, bread in their Mouths, and all the good creatures round about them, were pregnant refutations of their ſenſleſs Hereſy: the prints of goodneſs everywhere extant in Nature, ſhew the good hand which framed all.</p>
               <p>In the making of Man in his original integrity, there was yet a greater manifeſtation. In other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures there were the footſteps of God, but in Man there was his Image; a natural Image in the very make of his Soul, in the eſſential faculties of Reaſon and Will, upon which were derived more noble and divine prints of a Deity than upon all the World
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60626:11"/>beſides. And in that natural Image there was ſeated a moral one, ſtanding in that perfect knowledg and righteouſneſs, in which more of the beauty and glory of God did ſhine forth, than in the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Soul it ſelf. His Mind was a pure Lamp of Knowledg without any miſts or dark ſhades a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, his Will a mirrour of Sanctity and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude without any ſpot in it; and, as an acceſſion to the two former images, there was an image of Gods Soveraignty in him, he was made Lord over the brutal World; without, the beaſts were in perfect ſubjection to him: and within, the affections. Now to ſuch an excellent creature, in his primitive glory, with a Reaſon in its juſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or full ſtature, the World was a very rare Spectacle; the ſtamps and ſignatures upon the creatures looked very freſh to his pure Paradiſical eyes: from within, and from without, he was filled with illuſtrious rays of a Deity: he ſaw God everywhere; within, in the frame and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine furniture of his Soul, and without, in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the impreſſes of goodneſs on them: he heard God every-where, in his own breaſt in the voice of a clear unvailed Reaſon, and abroad in the high language and dialect of Nature. All was in ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, the World ſhone as an outward Temple, and his heart was in luſtre like an Oracle or inward San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary; every thing in both ſpake to Gods honour. Such an excellent appearance as this, was worthy of a Sabbath to celebrate the praiſes of the Creator in. But alas! Sin ſoon entred and caſt a vail upon this Manifeſtation; on the World there fell a curſe, which preſſed it into groans and travelling pains of vanity; the Earth had its Thiſtles, the Heavens their ſpots and malignant influences, all was out of tune,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60626:11"/>and jarring into confuſion. In Man all the Images of God more or leſs ſuffered, the orient Reaſon was miſerably clouded, the holy Rectitude utterly loſt: without, the beaſts turned rebels; and within, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Nevertheleſs God, who is unwearied in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would further manifeſt himſelf. Promiſes of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and of grace in him, brake forth unto lapſed man; and as appendants thereof there came forth Sacrifices and other types to be figures of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, and a kind of Aſtrolabe to the pious <hi>Jews,</hi> that by earthly things they might aſcend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Celeſtial. Alſo the Moral Law was given forth by God, the ſpiritual Tables being broken, material ones were made; Holineſs and Righteouſneſs being by the fall driven out of their proper place, the heart of man, were ſet forth in letters and words in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue. This was ſo glorious a manifeſtation, that the <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſay, that Mountains of ſenſe hang upon every <hi>Iota</hi> of it. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in the <hi>19th Pſalm,</hi> having ſet forth how the Sun and Heavens ſhew forth Gods glory, raiſes up his diſcourſe to the perfect Law, which, as it enlightens the inward man, is a brighter luminary than the Sun which ſhines to ſenſe; and, as it comprizes all duties within it ſelf, is a nobler circle in Morality, than the Heavens which inviron all other bodies are in Nature. <hi>The Commandment,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>is exceeding broad,</hi> Pſalm 119.96: it is an Ocean of Sanctity and Equity, ſuch as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon, the ſoul and meaſure of civil Laws, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſearch to the bottom. Love to God and our Neighbour is the center of it; and as many right lines as may be drawn thither, ſo many are the duties of it. Whatſoever it be, that makes up the juſt poſture of man towards his Maker or fellow-creatures, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60626:12"/>therein. Humane Laws are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable orders, ſuch as turn about with time; but the Moral Law is by its intrinſecal rectitude ſo immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, that, as long as God is God, and man man, it cannot be altered.</p>
               <p>After all theſe Manifeſtations, God revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the World in and by Jeſus Chriſt; this is the laſt and greateſt appearance of all. In the inferiour creatures there is a footſtep of God, but not his Image; in man there is his Image, but a finite, a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one: but Jeſus Chriſt is the infinite increated Image of God. The nearer any creature doth in its perfections approach to God, the more it reveals him; life ſhews forth more of him than meer being, ſenſe than life, Reaſon than all the reſt: but oh! what a ſpectacle hath Faith, when an humane nature ſhall be taken into the Perſon of God, when the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead ſhall dwell in a creature Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically! Here the Eternal Word which framed the World was made fleſh; the infinite Wiſdom which lighted up Reaſon in man, aſſumed an Humanity; never was God ſo in man, never was man ſo united to God, as in this wonderful Diſpenſation: more glory breaks forth from hence than from all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We have here the Center of the Promiſes, the ſubſtance of the types and ſhadows, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the Moral Law, and Holineſs and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, not in letters and ſyllables, but living, breathing, walking, practically exemplified in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>JESUS CHRIST, as he is the eternal Son of God, is the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs Image of his perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. But becauſe our weakneſs could not bear ſo excellent a Glory without being ſwallowed up by it, he veiled himſelf in our fleſh, that he, who was light of light in the eternal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, might become the light of the World in an admirable Incarnation; and ſuch he was under a double notion. He may be conſidered either as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing the Goſpel, and thus he is the great Prophet, who from his Fathers boſom brought down ſo many pretious truths and myſteries to the World; or elſe as ſet forth in the Goſpel in his conception, birth, life, death, reſurrection and exaltation at Gods right hand; and thus he is <hi>ſpeculum Theologiae,</hi> a pure glaſs of Divinity. Hence the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>the light
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60626:13"/>of the knowledg of the glory of God is in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. This latter Notion is that which this diſcourſe aims at, to contemplate thoſe many Truths which are either lively expreſſed in the Incarnate Word, or may be reaſonably drawn from that incomparable Diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>God, that he might help our weakneſs, and attract our faith to himſelf, hath been pleaſed to come, as it were, out of his unapproachable light, and manifeſt himſelf in Attributes, ſuch as Wiſdom, Holineſs, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Grace, Mercy, Power, with the like. Theſe Rays of the divine Perfection are let down on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that we might ſanctifie him in our hearts, that our ſouls might be in a poſture of holy humility, faith, fear, love, joy, and obedience, ſuitable to thoſe Excellencies in him. My firſt work therefore muſt be, to ſhew how theſe Attributes are diſplayed in Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>We all with open face behold as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. Jeſus Chriſt is that pure Glaſs wherein the glory of God, that is, the divine Attributes, ſo eminently ſhine forth to us, that we may contemplate them with open face.</p>
               <p>To begin firſt with the Attribute of Wiſdom; this is the great Diſpoſer, which in all things places the Center and draws the lines, fixes the end and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monizes the means thereunto. There is a fair impreſs of it in the work of Creation, much more in that of Redemption: a Nobler end there cannot be than Gods glory in the Salvation of loſt man, nor a more admirable means than <hi>God manifeſt in the fleſh.</hi> This is <hi>the Wiſdom of God in a Myſtery,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7; a thing more ſublime than all the ſecrets in the Creation. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon may by its own innate light go into the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60626:13"/>outward Temple of Nature, but into the Sanctuary of Evangelical myſteries it cannot, unleſs ſupernatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illuminated, ever enter; and when it is there, it is capable but of a little portion thereof: nay, the very Angels, who ſtoop down to pry into it, are not able to ſearch it to the bottom, nor to tell over the treaſures of Wiſdom which are in it. This is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the manifold wiſdom of God,</hi> Epheſ. 3.10. Never was ſuch a conſtellation of Attributes as there is here: that Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs which appeared in Creation, are here in greater luſtre; and over and above Holineſs, Juſtice and Mercy ſhine forth in their orient Excellencies: never did the glory of God ſo break forth, as it doth in this wonderful Diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>That we may the better view it, it will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to conſider, firſt, the obſtacles in the way, and then how admirably the divine Wiſdom did paſs through them and accompliſh the great Work.</p>
               <p>The Obſtacles were ſuch as theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Man turning apoſtate from his God and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Integrity, juſtly ſunk himſelf into an horrible gulf of ſin and miſery. Sin lay upon him, and wrath for ſin; the broken Law pronounced Death, an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal curſe againſt him; divine Juſtice appeared through the threatning like devouring fire, ready to catch hold on him as fit fuel for eternal flames; unleſs Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction were made, he muſt have gone into Hell, the proper place for irremediable ſinners: in this forlorn eſtate, what may he, can he, do? Shall he melt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into repentant tears, or conſecrate himſelf unto perpetual Holineſs? Alas! depraved Nature cannot elevate it ſelf unto theſe, nor will Grace diſpenſe them to an unatoned ſinner: nay, could they be had, they would be as finite nothings in compariſon of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60626:14"/>that infinite Satisfaction which Juſtice calls for. Sin is an infinite evil, objectively infinite, a kind of <hi>dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidium,</hi> a ſtriking at the Majeſty, Holineſs, Juſtice, nay, the very Life and Being of God, and without ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>deicidium,</hi> a <hi>crucifying the Lord of glory,</hi> which is a Sacrifice of infinite value, not to be expiated. Which conſideration alſo tells us, that all the Angels in Heaven, though creatures without ſpot, could not have been able to have ſatisfied for the ſin of man; all that they have is but finite, the burden of Gods wrath was much too heavy for them: one ſin ſunk their fellow-Angels into chains of darkneſs, and how could they ſtand under a world of iniquity? The titles of <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> which equal, if not exceed that of <hi>Creator,</hi> were too high for them: and how could they who knew their own ſtation, and were confirmed therein, attempt or ſo much as caſt an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring glance after them? Upon the whole matter, we ſee this firſt Obſtacle is ſuch, as no creature in Heaven and Earth was able to remove out of the way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Ex parte creaturae,</hi> the impoſſibility is apparent: may we look up to Heaven? There ſeems to be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion above, a kind of variance among the divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes: On the one hand Mercy, that tender indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Attribute, ſeems to melt and cry out over fallen man; What! ſhall man, made after the divine Image; a poor ſeduced creature, ſhall he, nay, his whole race Eternally periſh! ſhall I have never a Monument among the ſons of men, nay, nor in the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? ſhall nothing of the humane nature ſerve God or enjoy him? On the other, Juſtice pleaded, That every one muſt have his due, the wages of ſin is death; the Majeſty of Heaven muſt not be offended, nor his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60626:14"/>ſacred Law violated without a juſt recompence. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which cannot but abhor ſin, could do no leſs than ſtand on the ſame ſide. Truth remembred, that that threatning, <hi>moriendo morieris, Thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> was too ſacred a thing to be made nothing of; ſome way or other it ought to be ſatisfied. Thus the Attributes themſelves ſeem to be at a diſtance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Could a Ranſom be found out to the content of Juſtice, how ſhould man, depraved polluted man, be made capable of receiving ſuch a benefit? who ſhould unſcale his eyes, that he might look upon ſuch a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery? who ſhould break his iron-ſinewed will, that he might yield to ſuch terms, as Salvation was to be given upon? It is certain, that blind impenitent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cannot enter into Heaven; before they can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive thither, their eyes muſt be opened upon the great Offer, their hearts muſt be diſſolved into the divine Will; and how this ſhall come to paſs, is another dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. Now after the difficulties, let us ſee the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſolution of them: when all finite underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were poſed and nonpluſt at the caſe of fal'n man, when neither men nor Angels could ſo much as ſtart a thought touching a remedy, infinite Wiſdom found out a way of Salvation for us. The incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable contrivance was thus: A creature, a finite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could not ſatisfie Juſtice, but an infinite one ſhall do it. There are three perſons in the ſacred Trinity, but the Son of God ſhall do it; He ſhall aſſume an humane nature; in it He ſhall obey and die upon a Croſs, and thereby he ſhall ſatisfie divine Juſtice, and purchaſe Grace and Eternal life for us. That the Son ſhould do it rather than any other perſon, was very congruous many ways. Gods beloved One was fit to reconcile us, his eſſential Image was fit to repair the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60626:15"/>gracious one; none could be more meet to uſher in Adoption than Gods natural Son, nor to enlighten the World than the brightneſs of his glory: the Eternal Word Incarnate muſt needs be an excellent Prophet, the middle perſon in the ſacred Trinity a moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous Mediator. The bleſſed Father ſhewed forth himſelf in a former work in Creation; the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit appears in a ſubſequent work, in Sanctification; it was therefore very meet that the Son, the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, ſhould manifeſt himſelf in the middle work, in Redemption. But that we may look a little further into this admirable Deſign, it will not be amiſs to fix our eyes upon thoſe rare Conjunctions, which the divine Wiſdom hath framed in order to our Salvation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a Conjunction of Natures, God and Man in one perſon. Jeſus Chriſt, who was conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial with the Father as to his Divinity, was made conſubſtantial with us as to his Humanity; Heaven and Earth were united together in an ineffable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: the diſtance between God and man was, as it were, filled up in this wonderful Incarnation, <hi>ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum inſimi</hi> did <hi>attingere infimum ſupremi,</hi> the creature came as near God as poſſibly could be. Admirable are the tendencies of this Union. He was Man, that he might be capable of ſuffering, and that by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he might ſatisfie in the ſame Nature which had ſinned. He was God, that he might ſtamp ſuch an infinite value upon his ſufferings; that thoſe, though but the ſufferings of one, might anſwer for a World, and, though but temporal ſufferings, might counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe Eternal. He was Man, that in condeſcenſion to our weakneſs he might ſpeak to us through a vail of fleſh. He was God, that he might ſpeak to our hearts
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60626:15"/>in divine illuminations; in words of life and power. He was Man, that he might be touch'd with a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our infirmities, and melt into tender compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions towards us. He was God, that he might break all the powers of darkneſs, and erect an holy Throne in our hearts. This was the firſt fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, a thing worthy to attract from us a much higher admiration, than what is due to the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a Conjunction of Juſtice and Mercy. Theſe in men do uſually, like the Sun and Moon, reign by turns; but in this wonderful Diſpenſation theſe are in exerciſe and glory both at once. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice appears, in that Jeſus Chriſt our Sponſor was ſmitten and wounded to death, and that an accurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one for our ſins: Mercy ſhines forth, in that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners repenting and believing are ſpared, nay, and advanced to glory. Juſtice did not ſpare the Surety, but exacted all; Mercy doth not exact ought from the believer, but forgive all. The ſufferings of Chriſt reſpect both Attributes, they ſatisfied the Law, and founded the Goſpel. Juſtice had a full compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Mercy ſprung up in promiſes of Grace and Life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Holineſs in God, which hates ſin, is the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental root of that Juſtice, which puniſheth it. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment iſſues out of Juſtice; Juſtice ſprings out of Holineſs. Now that Holineſs may be contented, and ſo Juſtice ſatisfied, not only in it ſelf, but in its very foundation, there was in Chriſts Sufferings a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of puniſhment and obedience. It's true, the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> think theſe two altogether inconſiſtent,<note place="margin">Si Chriſti paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiones rationem obedientia habent, rationem poenae habere non poſſunt; obedientia enim virtus eſt, poena autem propter inobedientiam infligitur. <hi>Schlict. contr. Meiſn. 128.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60626:16"/>obedience is a Virtue, but puniſhment is inflicted for diſobedience. But in Scripture the thing is clear; there was a virtuous action in his Paſſion, a ſignal obedience in his Sufferings: he poured out his ſoul, he was obedient unto death. Pure entire obedience run through his whole life to the laſt gaſp upon the Croſs: it was not at all broken or interrupted by the bloody Agony, nor loſt or forſaken in that night of deſertion, when he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> His Sufferings were very penal in themſelves, and inflicted by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, yet freely undertaken, and obedientially under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone. Here therefore was an admirable work of Wiſdom; his Sufferings as penal ſatisfied Juſtice, and as obediential gratified Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Truth of God was concerned in that firſt Threatning, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> and in that other, which is a kind of Commentary upon it, <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all things.</hi> Theſe Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, which were the ſanction of that eternal Law, touching which our Saviour aſſures us, that one jot or tittle of it ſhall not paſs away, are not to be confounded with thoſe conditional Threatnings which are extant in Scripture, and were by God uſed to induce men unto repentance. Now that Truth might be ſalved, there was in Chriſts Sufferings a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Satisfaction, and a kind of execution of the Law. Indeed, an execution of it in the rigour or ſtrict letter of it there was not, neither could that be but upon the Sinner himſelf; yet there was a kind of execution of it in an equitable ſenſe in our Sponſor Jeſus Chriſt: his Satisfaction, though it was not the <hi>idem,</hi> the very ſame which the letter of the Law called for; yet in infinite Wiſdom it was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60626:16"/>accommodated to the terms of the Law, as far as the <hi>decorum</hi> of his Sacred Perſon could admit of; in the threatning there was Death and a Curſe, and both theſe were in the ſufferings of Chriſt: hence the Apoſtle ſaith, That ſin was ſo condemned in his fleſh, that the righteouſneſs of the Law was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. It was in a ſort executed in our Surety, that in the ſame ſufferings there might be a ſatisfaction to Juſtice, and a compliance with Truth. He that conſiders theſe Conjunctions will have cauſe to cry out with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Mercy and truth are met together, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed each other,</hi> Pſalm 85.10.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That poor lapſed man with his blind eyes and hard heart, utterly uncapable in himſelf of Heaven, may be made meet for it; there was in Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings a conjunction of Satisfaction and Merit; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice was compenſated, and Grace impetrated. Indeed the <hi>Socinians,</hi> blind with their own corrupt reaſon, cannot ſee how theſe two ſhould ſtand together,<note place="margin">ubi eſt ſatisfactlo, ibi non eſt meritum; Satisfactio eſt ſolutio debiti de jure, meritum autem opus indebitum. <hi>Soc.</hi>
                  </note> Satisfaction being the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a juſt debt, and Merit the doing of an undue work. To which I anſwer: It is true, that when one pays a finite ſum for his own debt, there is not, there cannot be a merit in it; but when Jeſus Chriſt paid down ſufferings of an infinite value for us, there cannot but be an immenſe merit in them. Infinity is an Ocean, and may run over in effects as far as it pleaſes; thoſe ſufferings had a kind of Infinity in them, enough to pay divine Juſtice, and over and above by a redundance of merit to purchaſe all grace for us. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt is ſhed on us abundantly through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Tit. 3.6.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60626:17"/>Chriſt aſcended up to Heaven in the glory of his Merits, and from thence poured down the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit on men, that their blind eyes might be opened upon the myſteries of the Goſpel, and their hard hearts might be melted into repentance. Thus a fair way is opened to make fal'n man capable of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Becauſe the inward vital principles of Grace in men muſt needs flouriſh moſt, when there is an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward excellent pattern of Holineſs ſet before them; there was therefore in Chriſts ſufferings a conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Merit and Example: the Merit procured the principles of Grace, and the Example by its divine beauty drew them out into imitation.<note place="margin">Vix fieri poſſe videtur, ut unâ &amp; eâdem re &amp; ſatisfiat, &amp; ſimul exemplum relinquatur, <hi>Socin. Prael.</hi> cap. <hi>20.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Socinus</hi> thinks, that a Satisfaction and an Example can very hardly meet together in the ſame thing; the like ſcruple may be made touching Merit and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: and the very truth is, Satisfaction and Merit are a Cup which we cannot drink of, a Sea in which we cannot trace or follow our Saviour. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, infinite Wiſdom laid one plot under another; and under inimitable Satisfaction and Merit, couch'd an incomparable pattern of Holineſs for us. We may clearly ſee in him, how we are to mortifie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, bear afflictions, learn obedience by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and obey unto the death. In theſe he hath left us an Example, that we might follow his ſteps, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.</p>
               <p>Having ſeen the contrivance in theſe rare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, let us now conſider how the Divine Wiſdom ſet Ambuſhments for our ſpiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: I mean, Sin, Satan, the World, and Death; all which are in a very admirable manner over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60626:17"/>by Jeſus Chriſt. Sin, which meritoriouſly was the bloody crucifier of the Son of God, was crucified toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him when he ſuffered; it was in his fleſh condemned as an accurſed thing worthy to die; no ſooner are we in him by Faith, but it loſes its kingdom, and by a divine Virtue from his Croſs, it droops and languiſhes away in us.</p>
               <p>Satan the arch-enemy, at Chriſts death ſeemed to be a Conqueror; that God Incarnate ſhould be ſlain by his helliſh Inſtruments, that the whole Church ſhould die in its Head, looks like a mighty Victory: when the Head ſhall die, what ſhall the Members do? when the Sun, the great Globe of Light in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual World, ſhall be turned into blood; what ſhould remain but that darkneſs, which Satan hath the power of? Upon the death of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe, Henry</hi> the Third broke out thus, <hi>Nunc demum Rex ſum.</hi> Now at laſt I am King. Upon the death of our Saviour, Satan might ſuppoſe himſelf abſolute Prince in the lower World; a greater <hi>Adam</hi> than the firſt being fallen, no man can probably ſtand before him. But here infinite Wiſdom ſhews forth it ſelf. Satan is taken in his own ſnare; by that very death of Chriſt, which was procured by his own Agents, is he utterly overthrown. Chriſt upon the Croſs did ſpoil Principalities and Powers, and triumph over them in it, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. The ſatisfaction in his ſufferings, paid off divine Juſtice, and the Merit in them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured that divine Spirit, which is able to bind and caſt out Satan from the hearts of men. The Croſs was now turned into a triumphant Chariot: and, as an Ancient hath it, there were two affixed to it;<note place="margin">Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were for Wiſdom, ſaw nothing but fooliſhneſs in the midſt of the divine Myſteries, which he brought down out of his Fathers Boſom. A crucified Chriſt look'd like a ſpectacle of weakneſs and folly. But here the divine Wiſdom appears, in that, as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>The fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than men, and the weakneſs of God ſtronger than men.</hi> This crucified Chriſt ſhall attract a Church out of the corrupt Maſs of mankind; the fooliſhneſs of Preaching ſhall do it. The <hi>Plato</hi>'s or <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> of the World ſhall not be employed in the work; no, there ſhall be only <hi>Piſcatoria ſimplicitas,</hi> a few Fiſhermen ſhall catch men, and draw them home unto God; to the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, this deſpiſed Chriſt ſhall be the power

               <p>Death, the laſt Enemy, which had devoured ſo much humane fleſh, did not ſpare that Sacred por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was aſſumed into the Son of God: but in his death, Death it ſelf was ſwallowed up in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. It paſſes indeed upon all men; but when it comes to a Believer, it lays by its ſting, and becomes only a paſſage into life Eternal.</p>
               <p>To conclude: In all theſe Conqueſts, we may ſee one Contrary brought out of another: Life out of Death, Power out of Weakneſs, a Bleſſing out of a Curſe, and a Victory out of Sufferings, which ſpeaks no leſs than an admirable contrivance therein.</p>
               <p>Theſe appearances of Divine Wiſdom naturally teach us humility of mind. Humane Reaſon is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in its own Orb an excellent Light; but a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than it, the Reaſon of God himſelf, comes forth to us in ſupernatural Myſteries, to make us ſit down at his feet for Inſtruction. Nothing can be more juſt and purely rational, than for our Intellect being finite, to be ſubject to the infinite Truth; and being lighted up by God, to do homage to its great Original. It's true, ever ſince man taſted of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, his Reaſon hath had a malignant pride in it: of a Miniſter it would be a Lord over our Faith; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the Magiſterial Chair, it would fall a-judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Divine Myſteries; it would comprehenſively ſpan them within it ſelf: and what could not be ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, it would out of enmity caſt away as ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. This in the iſſue hath, ſo far as it hath prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60626:19"/>deſperately overturned all Faith, in the act and in the object: in the act, for to believe a thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I can comprehend it, is not faith in God, but truſting in my own heart; not a ſealing to his Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, but a ſubſcribing to my own Sagacity. Hence the learned <hi>Mareſius</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> That they have <hi>manus oculatas,</hi> hands with eyes in them; that only do they believe which they ſee; they will truſt God no further than they ſee him. Alſo in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; this hath been very ſubverſive to the Goſpel. In the <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſophers (whoſe Motto was, <hi>Soli rationi cedo</hi>), it caſt away Chriſt crucified as fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Goſpel as an abſurd Fable; it reflected on Chriſtians as meer Simpletons, men of an eaſie and irrational faith; hence that jeer of <hi>Cato, Stultitia eſt morte alterius ſperare ſalutem;</hi> it's folly to hope for ſalvation in the death of another. In the <hi>Socinians,</hi> (whoſe Rule is, <hi>Nihil credi poteſt, quod a ratione ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queat capi,</hi> nothing can be believed, which cannot be comprehended by Reaſon); it hath blown up the fundamental Articles of Chriſtianity: the ſacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to them is a contradiction; the Hypoſtatical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an irrational repugnancy; the Satisfaction of Chriſt a contumely to Gods grace: and in all this they do but build a Tower, a Name to their own Reaſon; and, as a juſt puniſhment, in the doing of it they fall into confuſion and inconſiſtencies.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar. Hydra.</hi> Tom. 2.460.</note> Sometimes they make the Law to exact a more perfect obedience than the Goſpel: Sometimes the Goſpel to call for a more accurate righteouſneſs than the Law. To evert Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, they lift up Grace; but to elevate Free-will, they depreſs it. They own a God, yet deny his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; they ſay Chriſt is but a creature, yet they worſhip him. Thus that great thing, Reaſon, falling
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60626:19"/>from the ſupreme Truth, becomes a forlorn ſpectacle of vanity. In a kind of ſelf-ſplendor it goes out in the darkneſs of errour and confuſion. But now to humble our minds, it is of excellent uſe to conſider the divine Wiſdom, which is ſo much above us. When our Reaſon ſtands by ſenſe, it hath a noble ſtature and greatneſs; but, as ſoon as it turns about to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom, it perceives a greater Preſence than it ſelf, and muſt in all reaſon confeſs it ſelf a little ſpark, a very Nothing in compariſon. It cannot ſtep out into the ſphere of Nature, but it finds matter of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; being true to it ſelf, it can do no leſs than ſay, that it is everywhere poſed and nonpluſt. It is not able rationally to ſtand under the ſecrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, much more muſt it ſtoop and do reverence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a Myſtery as that is, <hi>God manifeſt in the fleſh;</hi> in which the tranſcendent Myſtery amazes us, and the unparallel'd Pattern draws us into humility. Thither muſt we come, or elſe turn Infidels, and allow Reaſon for a Deity; ſaying with <hi>Seneca, Quid aliud voces animam, quàm Deum in humano corpore hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantem?</hi> What is the rational Soul but God dwelling in fleſh, a kind of Chriſt, or rather Antichriſt? This, I am ſure Chriſtian ears cannot bear. But a little more to demonſtrate how neceſſary a thing humility of mind is; let us conſider Reaſon in a three-fold ſtate: then it will appear, that Reaſon in its Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could not find out ſupernatural Myſteries; in its Fall cannot ſpiritually know them; and laſtly, in the irradiations of Faith cannot comprehend them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reaſon in its Integrity could not find them out. The pure primitive light in <hi>Adam</hi> could dive into the ſecrets of Nature, but it could not reach ſuch a Myſterie as that of the ſacred Trinity, which is the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60626:20"/>fundamental center of Chriſtian Religion. He could name the creatures, and that ſignificantly to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but that Queſtion, <hi>What is his ſons name,</hi> Prov. 30.4, would have been too hard for him. There are, ſay the School-men, ſome obſcure Images of the Trinity in the Volume of Nature, but they were found out <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> and not to be read till after Revelation; and how ſhould humane Reaſon dictate in thoſe things which it could not find out? or know any thing from it ſelf, when it hath all from Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? Nothing can be more abſurd than ſuch a preſumption.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Reaſon in its Fall could not ſpiritually know them. Evangelical Myſteries being propoſed, it can go as far as its own line, unto letters, and words, and ſentences: it can gather in a Notion, a form of knowledg, but it wants a congruous light; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpiritually diſcern them, there being no alliance or reſemblance between an unregenerate mind and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Myſteries. Were it not thus, the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would be new only <hi>ex parte,</hi> there would need no renovation in the ſpirit of the mind; God, who propoſes the Object, need not ſhine into the heart; the Spirit of Wiſdom which reveals the Goſpel, need not open the eyes. We muſt either affirm ſuch things as theſe, or elſe confeſs that Reaſon of it ſelf hath not light enough to be Umpire in ſupernatural My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. It doth not ſpiritually diſcern them, and for that cauſe cannot be an Umpire; and, as ſoon as by ſupernatural Illumination it diſcerns them, it will not, dares not be ſuch, but with all reverence acquieſces and repoſes it ſelf in the divine Teſtimony: <hi>Deus dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it</hi> then is enough.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:60626:20"/>
               <p n="3">3. Reaſon in the irradiations of Faith cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them: a diſcerning there is, but no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; let the Believer ſail as far as he can in the purſuit of holy Truths, ſtill there will be a <hi>Plus ultrà,</hi> an Abyſs, a vaſt Ocean, ſuch as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane underſtanding can never paſs through. Faith ſeals to Gods Veracity, but it offers not to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Myſterie; it believes the thing ſo to be, but it pryes not into the <hi>Modus,</hi> nor ſaith, <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> that is the voice of depraved Reaſon, not of Faith, whoſe excellent genius is to crucifie <hi>How's</hi> and <hi>Why's,</hi> and to ſubject the mind to the Word and Authority of God.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being ſo, we ſhould be all over cloathed with Humility, Underſtanding and all. The higher the faculty is, the more excellent is the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; then is God honoured indeed, when <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, all the Intellect, the higheſt thing in man, is ſubjected unto Him.</p>

It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports an hatred of ſin, and love of Holineſs in man. In all theſe reſpects it was manifeſt in Chriſt. It was not indecent for God to come in the fleſh and die; the Glory of God breaks forth therein. His hatred of fin, and deſign to extirpute it; His love to Holineſs, in doing ſo much to recover it, and linking it with Salvation. We ſhould be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of God therein.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAVING ſeen the Attribute of Wiſdom in God, I proceed to that of Holineſs, which is the glory of the Deity. He is called <hi>the Hoty One</hi> above thirty times in Scripture: the Seraphims in an Extaſie cry out <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy;</hi> denoting by that repetition the ſuperlative Eminency of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This is an univerſal Attribute, which runs through all the other. Hence we find in Scripture that His Power or Arm is Holy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.10. His Truth or Promiſe Holy, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 105.42. His Mercy Holy, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.34. A vein of Purity runs through His whole Name. Without Holineſs his Wiſdom would be Subtilty, His Juſtice Cruelty, His Soveraignty Tyranny, His Mercy fooliſh Pity; all would degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into ſomething unworthy of God. Holineſs is the infinite Purity and Rectitude of his Eſſence; and it may be conſidered either reſpectively to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or to the creature. Reſpectively to himſelf it includes two things:</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60626:21"/>
               <p n="1">1. That God, in all that he doth, acts like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in a juſt <hi>decorum</hi> to his excellent Being and Attributes, having no Law without or above him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He conforms to his Eſſence, and carries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo fitly to himſelf, that no ſpot, no darkneſs, no ſhadow of turning, no indecency or irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can poſſibly happen to him. He cannot deny himſelf, or do any thing unworthy of his Being or Attributes. He doth whatever he doth, in ſuch a manner as becomes Him. Hence <hi>Anſelm</hi> obſerves, That when God ſpares and is merciful towards ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,<note place="margin">Juſtus es ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum te, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericors es ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum nos. <hi>Proſol. cap. 10.</hi>
                  </note> he is juſt to Himſelf, and that becauſe he acts condecently to his infinite Goodneſs. This is the firſt and prime part of his Holineſs, to be juſt and true to Himſelf, to do all congruouſly to his own Excellency.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God doth all things for Himſelf, his own Glory. He that is <hi>Alpha,</hi> the firſt Principle of all things, muſt of neceſſity be <hi>Omoga,</hi> the laſt End of them: his Sanctity requires, that all his works ſhould return and give glory to their Original; he ſhould not be true or juſt to Himſelf, if he ſhould have any Center beſides himſelf; his Holineſs is a Tranſcendent above that in Man. Supreme Self-love, which in man is a <hi>Belial</hi> thing, is a Perfection in Him: To do all for one's ſelf, which in man is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, it is true Sanctity in Him. It is moſt proper for him, the ſupreme Cauſe and Eſſence, to make all things for Himſelf; as <hi>of and through him,</hi> ſo <hi>to him are all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Gods Holineſs taken reſpectively to the Greature, imports two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It imports an hatred of ſin: His pure Eyes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60626:22"/>not look upon it with approbation; His righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hands will not let it go unpuniſhed. Sin is a very vile thing, it deſpiſes Gods Authority, caſts off his Soveraignty, contradicts his Purity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes his Juſtice; nay, it ſtrikes at his very Being: it ſays, Who is Lord, that he ſhould be obeyed? It is the moſt prodigious. Rebel that ever was; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, folly, corruption riſing up in arms againſt Power, Wiſdom, and infinite Perfection. The Holy One, becauſe he is ſuch, muſt needs hate ſuch a filthy abominable thing: He can no more ceaſe to hate it, than he can ceaſe to be Holy. His antipathy againſt it is ſo great, that he can no more admit one drop of it into himſelf, than he can ſuffer an extincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Eſſence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It imports a love of Holineſs in the creature. Holineſs is a very choice thing; 'tis a pure breath from God, a participation of the Divine Nature: an Image or reſemblance of the Deity; more of the beauty and glory of God ſhines forth in it, than in all the world beſides. The other creatures are but a dark ſhadow to it; nay, it is a thouſand times more divine than the Soul it ſelf. The Holy One, who loves himſelf, muſt needs love ſo excellent a Picture of his own Sanctity. <hi>The righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, Pſalm</hi> 11.7; becauſe he is righteous in himſelf, therefore he loves righteouſneſs in the creature.</p>
               <p>Such, as I ſaid, is Gods Holineſs; The diſplay of it in Jeſus Chriſt ſucceeds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt part of his Holineſs, by which he does all in a juſt <hi>decorum</hi> to his excellent Being, ſeems to be contradicted in this Diſpenſation. May
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60626:22"/>God be made fleſh? May Majeſty be humbled? May the immutable One be changed in an Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? May the immortal One die in a bloudy Paſſion? Theſe things at the firſt bluſh look as if they could not be congruouſly done. But I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, The corrupt Reaſon of Man, which would ſhape all things according to its own model and Idea, hath, under colour of avoiding indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and inconveniencies, made very ſtrange work about this Myſterie. In the <hi>Pagan Sophi,</hi> it look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a crucified God as meer folly and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. In the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> it reproached Chriſt as a <hi>Talui,</hi> a poor hanged man, altogether inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be a Meſſiah or Saviour. In the Hereticks of the Church, it tore and mangled his ſacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon all to pieces, and that under pretence of avoiding one inconvenience or other. <hi>Arius,</hi> that he might not fall into that Gentile-vanity, a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Gods, took away Chriſts Deity. <hi>Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris</hi> ſpared his Deity, but took away his humane Soul; the room of that being better ſupplied by the Deity. <hi>Saturninus</hi> and <hi>Baſilides</hi> took away his body, leaving only a Phantaſm, a meer <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbra</hi> in the room of it: or if there muſt be a real Body, <hi>Apelles</hi> thought fit that it ſhould be a Sydereal one, which in his paſſage from Heaven he aſſumed, and after his Reſurrection reſtored again.<hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Noli gloriari, Judaee, non crucifixiſtl De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. <hi>So</hi> Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias.</note> leſt the impaſſible Deity ſhould ſuffer, would have two Chriſts; one the Son of man who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, another the Son of God, who dwelt in the other as in his Temple. <hi>Eutyches,</hi> ſuppoſing that there could not be two Natures in Chriſt, without two Perſons, thought it convenient, that after the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60626:23"/>Union there ſhould be but one Nature in Chriſt; the humane Nature being ſwallowed up in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. And the reaſon of all this is, becauſe, as an Ancient hath it touching the <hi>Eutychians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In hanc in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipientiam ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt, qui, cum ad cognoſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam veritatem aliquo impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untur obſcuro, non ad prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticas voces, non ad Apoſtolicas literas, non ad Evangelicas authoritates, ſed ad ſemetip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſos recurrunt: ideo magiſtri erroris exiſtunt, quia veritatis diſcipuli non ſuere. <hi>Leo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Epiſt. 10.</hi>
                  </note> they look not ſo much to the Sacred Scriptures, as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being willing that their own Reaſon ſhould be Umpire in ſacred Myſteries; they become Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Errour, who would not be Diſciples of Truth. By this heap of Experiments we may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, that the <hi>decorum</hi> of this Myſterie is too great a thing to be judged by humane Reaſon: if we will know any thing of it, we muſt addreſs our ſelves to the divine Oracle, Jeſus Chriſt, the infinite increated Wiſdom of God, who never had ſo much as an indecorous thought, <hi>delighted in the ſons of men, Prov.</hi> 8.31. in the proſpect of a future Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a thing becoming him, to <hi>fulſil all righteouſneſs, Matth.</hi> 3.15; when yet it could not have become him in an unbocoming Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. There was a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>muſt,</hi> upon his Death and Sufferings, <hi>Mutth.</hi> 16.21; when yet it was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible, that my neceſſity ſhould preſs him into an indecency. There was therefore an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent congruity in this Myſterie. God indeed was made fleſh, but how? <hi>Non mutando quod erat, ſed aſſumendo quod non erat,</hi> not by changing his Deity, but by aſſuming his Humanity. Majeſty was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, not in it ſelf, but in the aſſumed fleſh, which was as a Veil over all the Glory. The change and death was not in the Divine, but Humane nature, which was taken into his Sacred Perſon in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnition, and ſuffered death in his Paſſion upon the Groſs. There was a juſt <hi>decorum</hi> in all: Nay,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60626:23"/>in this very Myſterie, at which humane Reaſon cries out of indecency, God hath hid ſuch an Abyſs of Wiſdom, as no created Underſtanding is able to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom; a glimpſe of which appears in the next par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That part of Holineſs, by which God doth all things for himſelf, for his own Glory, eminently appears in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In general it appears, that God is the great Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ultimate end of all; and all creatures, none excepted, are as ſo many Lines and Mediums tending thereunto. The Humane nature of Chriſt, a Creature above all creatures, lifted up above the higheſt pitch of Angels, elevated into an Union with an inſinite Perſon, was not yet a Center to it ſelf. It had no ſubſiſtence of its own, neither did it operate for it ſelf; <hi>I ſeek not mine own glory,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.50. Nay, He adds, <hi>If I honour my ſelf, my honour is nothing;</hi> as much as to ſay, a creature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to it ſelf is an unprofitable Nullity. In all his Doings and Sufferings, he did but miniſter to the Will and Glory of God; in the end he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the Kingdom to the Father, <hi>that God may be all in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.24, &amp; 28. Hence it is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively evident, that no Creature, no, not the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, is or can be an End or Center to it ſelf; all of them are but as Medium's to the glory of God: all muſt circulate into their firſt Fontal-principle, that it in all things may be glorified. In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, the Glory of God breaks forth in this Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Jeſus Chriſt, who in reſpect of the eternal genetation is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ſplendor or glorious effulgence of his Fathers glory, is in the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60626:24"/>the Glaſs or bright Evidence of the Divine. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies. Never was there ſuch a Conſtellation of Attributes as here. Wiſdom in the deep of its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Counſels laid the great plot of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Juſtice was paid to the full in Sufferings infinitely valuable, ſuch as did more than ballance the ſufferings of a World. Holineſs was abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gratified in the pure and ſpotleſs obedience of our Saviour, which was as a Gloſs and living Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the whole Law. Mercy and Love opened a boſom of infinite ſweetneſs to receive pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſouls into favour and a bleſſed Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Power raiſed up an humane Nature in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way, and then ſhewed forth it ſelf therein in the glory of innumerable Miracles. Truth triumphed, in that He who is the complement of the Law, the ſubſtance of the Shadows, and the Center of the Promiſes, was come into the World. Never did the brightneſs of Glory ſo excellently manifeſt it ſelf as upon the Theatre of Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. Hence Heaven and Earth ring with the high Praiſes of it. At his Nativity an Hoſt of Angels cry out, <hi>Glory to God in the Higheſt,</hi> Luke 2.14. In the Church there is glory to him by Jeſus Chriſt throughout all Ages, <hi>world without end,</hi> Epheſ. 3.21. Saints and Angels muſt now fall upon their faces, and ſay, <hi>Bleſſing, Glory, and Wiſdom, and Thanksgiving, and Honour, and Power, and Might be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen,</hi> Revel. 7.12. Eternity it ſelf will be little enough to ſpend in the praiſes of this incomparable Myſterie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Holineſs, as it imports an hatred of ſin, ſignal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrates it ſelf in this Diſpenſation. God
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60626:24"/>hath many ways manifeſted his hatred of ſin. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Threatning, in which he ſpeaks, as it were, out of the fire, and breathes out a Death and a Curſe againſt it. It further appears, when the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning comes forth in actual Judgments, in which God falls upon his own creature, the work of his own hands. It more appears, when Wrath comes down, not upon this or that ſinner, but upon mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes; and not upon the offending perſons only, but upon their Infant-relations; upon their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures, upon the very places where they acted their iniquities. <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, and Wrath fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole Race of mankind: nay, and a Blaſt and a Curſe fell upon the Creation; ſuch as makes it groan and travel in pain with an univerſal Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The old World was drowned in ſenſualities, and a Deluge ſweeps away them and their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures. The <hi>Sodomites</hi> burned in their unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral luſts, and fire and brimſtone was rained down upon them. <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> turned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and the Earth opened her mouth and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up them, and all that appertained to them. Theſe are notable Tokens of diſpleaſure, but a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is yet behind. The Eternal Son of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſume our fleſh, and ſtand as a Sponſor for us, but he muſt bear an infinite Wrath, ſuch as was due to the ſin of a World. Though he were the Wiſdom of God, he muſt be ſore amazed, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to faint away in a fit of horror; Though the Fathers joy, he muſt be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſurrounded with ſorrows even unto death. He bore up all things, yet now under the burden of Wrath he muſt fall and grovel upon the ground: He muſt pour out
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60626:25"/>tears and ſtrong cryes to God, that the bitter Cup may paſs; He muſt be in an Agony, a diſmal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with the Wrath of God, and ſweat great dropt and clotters of blood under the preſſure of it. The bleſſed and beloved One of God he was, yet he muſt be made a Curſe, and upon a tormenting Croſs cry out, <hi>My God! My God! why huſt thou for ſuken me?</hi> The Sun muſt now withdraw his light, and the Earth quake in ſympathy with their Creator. Oh! What a ſpectacle of diſpleaſure was here! What is a Deluge, or the groans of a diſſolving World in compariſon? There meer creatures ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, but here God in the fleſh. The Marks of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wrath were now ſet upon that humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which, as aſſumed into an infmite Perſon, is far above all the Greation. Never was there ſo high a demonſtration of Gods infinite hatred and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy againſt ſin, as there is here. No created Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of Men or Angels could ever have found out ſuch a wonderful Manifeſtation as this is, Infinite Wifdom did it, to make ſin look like it ſelf, infinitely odious.</p>
               <p>Moreover, As it is the nature of Hatred to be a Murderer, to ſeek the not being of the thing ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ſo it was the great Deſign of this Myſterie to extirpate ſin out of the hearts of men. <hi>For this purpoſe was the Son of God mantjeſted, that he might the ſtroy the works of the devil,</hi> 1 John 3.8. There are three things in ſin: the guilt, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the being. The aim of a crucified Chriſt was to extirpate there all: Chriſt was made Sin and a Curſe for us. He did by his ſweet-ſinelling Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifice fully fatisfie the Law and Juſtice of God:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60626:25"/>And why did he do it, but that the bonds of guilt might be broken off from us? The ſtrength of ſin, in binding us over to Death and Hell, is the Law; and the Law, in its threatning of a Curſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, is the voice of vindictive Juſtice: theſe two being fully ſatisfied in Chriſt, the guilt of ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes powerleſs, and unable to hold ſuch ſinners, as by Faith and Repentance partake in that Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. There was in Chriſts Sufferings, not only a fulneſs of Satisfaction, but a redundance of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Thereby he procured the Holy Spirit for us; and why ſo, but that the power of ſin might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in us? Our own ſpirit of it ſelf could not, would not do this; but the divine Spirit, which Chriſt hath procured, doth in true Believers ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. Sin is no longer a prevailing-Law in the heart; the Holy Spirit takes away its dominion, that the Throne of Chriſt may be ſet there. It is true, as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Velis, nolis, infra fines tuos habitat Jebuſaeus.</hi> Sin hath a being in Believers; but even that doth the holy Spirit in the Article of Death remove from them, that their Souls may fly away into that pure Region, where are <hi>the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> Thus God manireſts his hatred of ſin, in that he laid in the Sufferings of Chriſt a deſign for the extirpation of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Gods Holineſs, as it imports a love of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in man, is here, clearly ſeen, in that, when it was loſt, he did ſo much for the recovery of it. Holineſs, that divine Life (being by the Fall beaten out of the heart of man) ſtood without in the letter of the Law; but that it might be recovered into the heart of man again, that his heart might
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60626:26"/>be made a Sanctuary, an holy Place for the divine Majeſty to dwell and take pleaſure in, God hath done very much, and been at a vaſt expence about it. He hath not only wiſhed for Holineſs; <hi>O that there were ſuch an heart in them!</hi> Deut. 5.29; but he hath ſent his own Son into the fleſh to be a rare Pattern and Samplar of it; nay, and to bleed and die upon a Croſs, that it might be revived in poor fallen man. It could not be revived there without the holy Spirit, and that could never have been had, unleſs Juſtice were ſatisfied; and Satisfaction could not be made without a Sacrifice of infinite value. Chriſt therefore was made ſuch an One, that the holy Spirit might come and re-imprint Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in man again. God died in the fleſh, that man might live in the Spirit. One great end of Chriſts ſufferings, was Holineſs; <hi>He gave himſelf for us, that he might purifie to himſelf a peculiar people,</hi> Tit. 2.14; <hi>that he might have a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle,</hi> Epheſ. 5.27. Rather than loſe Holineſs, which is the Glory, He would humble himſelf to the ſhame of a Croſs; rather than we ſhould not be ſanctified, or conſecrated to God in Holineſs, he would ſanctifie and conſecrate himſelf to be a ſacrifice to Juſtice. Oh! What a rate or value doth God ſet upon Holineſs in man! How highly muſt he delight and take pleaſure in it, when he will come in the fleſh and die, rather than ſuffer it to be extinct in the World? a greater demonſtration of Love to it than this cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be imagined.</p>
               <p>Further, Gods love to Holineſs appears in this, that he orders things ſo, that no man can partake
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60626:26"/>of Jeſus Chriſt, unleſs he ſubject himſelf to the holy terms of the Goſpel: he <hi>that names the Name of Chriſt,</hi> muſt <hi>depart from iniquity.</hi> What if Chriſt be a moſt glorious Saviour and Redeemer? What though he fulfilled Righteouſneſs and made Satisfaction? What though he opened a way into the Holy of Holies, into the Glory and Immortality there? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, without Repenting there is nothing but periſhing; without Holineſs there is no ſeeing of God. A life after the fleſh muſt end in death. The divine Juſtice and Law, which was fully ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt, will ſeize upon rebellious ſinners, and ask a ſecond Satisfaction, as if there had been none before: the divine hatred of ſin, which was ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally evident in the ſufferings of Chriſt, will appear again in their utter ruin and deſtruction. Things are ſo knit together, that Holineſs muſt be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make us happy. Chriſt is a Saviour and a Lord too; where he ſaves from Hell, there he rules in the pure ways towards Heaven. His blood and Spirit are ever in Conjunction: if the one deliver from Guilt and Wrath, the other ſubdues ſin, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plants Holineſs. Promiſes and Precepts, which are intermixed in the Word, muſt be both taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the heart; where the latter hath not obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the former can miniſter no comfort. True Faith receives an entire Chriſt; as it reſts upon his Merits and Righteouſneſs, ſo it ſubjects to his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Word in all things. That hope of Heaven, which purifies not, is indeed a Prefumption and not an Hope; a Cobweb hanging in a vain heart, and not an Anchor ſure and ſtedfaſt, entring into that within the Vail. God out of love to Holineſs
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60626:27"/>hath linked it in with Chriſt, Promiſes, Faith, Heaven, and Salvation, that no man can or may enjoy the one without the other; till Chriſt can be divided, his Sacrifice from his Scepter; till Promiſes can be rent off from the holy Precepts, to which they are annexed; till a vital Faith can ceaſe to do its fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in acts of obedience; till the holy Heavens can admit an unclean thing into them: till then, an unholy perſon cannot arrive at Happineſs. In all this we ſee, how high a reſpect God hath for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
               <p>Now what remains, but that Chriſtians, who have this glorious Attribute ſet before them, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think themſelves, what manner of perſons they ought to be. God acts like himſelf; Should not they do ſo? their <hi>decorum</hi> ſtands in an holy Aſſimilation to him. Chriſtianity is, as an Ancient hath it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a likeneſs to God, to be after him in his imitable Perfections: to be loving, merciful, holy, patient, as He is, is to be, and act like themſelves. One Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of God or other ſhould be ſtill breaking forth from them, to tell the World that they are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Their finite love and mercy to fellow-creatures, ſhould ſpeak their ſenſe of that infinite love and mercy which they have taſted of: Their patience under in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries ſhould carry a reſemblance of thoſe Riches of goodneſs and forbearance, which God hath ſpent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves: All their holy Graces ſhould appear as ſo many Rays and little Images of Him, who is the great Fountain and pattern of Holineſs. For them to walk worthy of God, and in imitation of him, is to walk condecently to themſelves, and in correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence to Chriſtianity. Again, God doth all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60626:27"/>things for Himſelf, his own Glory, and this muſt be the aim of Chriſtians: To be a Center to themſelves, they muſt not do it; an higher and nobler End than God himſelf cannot be. It is naturally juſt, that He, who is the firſt Principle of all things, ſhould be the laſt End. That Axiom, That God in all things muſt be glorified, is fundamental Divinity; that is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, which they muſt look to as their ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſcope. They ſhould put away the by-glances at Self, and the unbecoming Squints at baſe and falſe Ends; that they may have a ſingle Eye, and a pure Intention to the true and great End of all things. This is the very life and marrow of Religion: it ſanctifies holy Duties; it ſpiritualizes civil and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Actions; it elevates the life unto the great Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all things, and by conſecrating the Actions unto God, gives them a kind of Immortality. It transforms the Soul into a deiformity or divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it becomes one ſpirit with the Lord, and falls in with the ſame Will and End with him. If we will be like Chriſtians, the frame of our heart muſt be above the intereſts of fleſh and ſelf. All thoſe things, which are off from the true End and Center, muſt be in our eyes as ſo many impertinent follies: the whole of our hearts and lives muſt be under a conſecration to that Eternal Deſign, The Glory of God bleſſed for ever. Moreover, God hath an hatred of ſin, and a love of Holineſs; and what is the work of Chriſtians, but to follow him? Sin is ſo vile an evil, that it cannot but be worthy of hatred. To the holy God and his Attributes it is meer enmity and rebellion; to the World it is a Gurſe, a blaſt of Vanity; to the Soul an Ataxy,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60626:28"/>turpitude, and corruption; to the Lord Chriſt as Nails, a bloody Croſs, and Cup of Wrath. A horrible evil it is, and to be hated accordingly; a meer evil without mixture of good, and to be hated with a pure hatred without mixture of Love. An All-evil oppoſite to God the All-goodneſs, and to be hated with all-hatred: not a drop or degree of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred ſhould be let out upon any thing elſe. All of it in the moſt intenſe degree and meaſure ſhould be poured out upon it; in what place or time ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, ſtill it is evil, and upon that account to be hated perpetually and in all places. And indeed, if we do bethink our ſelves, the groans of the poor creatures, which are conſtant and everywhere round about us, do very ſtrongly move us hereunto; the blots and turpitudes upon our own Souls tell us, that we muſt hate it, as much as we love the beauty and glory of our immortal Spirits. The bloud and wounds of our dear Saviour, cry out for Juſtice and Vengeance to be executed upon it. And, if we have any love for him, we muſt crucifie it and caſt it away as an accurſed thing. On the other hand, Holineſs cannot but be a fit Object for our love. It is a pure thing let down from Heaven; and, if our love be there, it can do no leſs than embrace ſo divine an off-ſpring as that is. It is the very rectitude and true temper of Souls, that which ſets them in a right poſture towards God and all holy things: and for that reaſon, more love is to be ſet upon it, than that which is due to our own Souls. Though in man it be but a little Ray or ſpark; yet, becauſe of its divine Nature, it doth in little reſemble him, who is all Holineſs and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60626:28"/>and upon that account, our love, which in its higheſt meaſures aſcends up to Him, muſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion be due to it. The amiableneſs of it in the Letter, made the Holy man cry out, <hi>Oh how I love thy Law!</hi> Pſalm 119.97; and how illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and attractive muſt it be, when it is in its proper <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi,</hi> living and breathing in the ſpirits of men? Rather than it ſhould not revive there, God would be manifeſt in the fleſh, and die in it. And how ſhould we die to our ſelves and the World, that it may live in us? Which, when it doth, we live indeed, and that a life more divine and of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Excellency, than is the life of meer Senſe or Reaſon; nay, this life is complicated with Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and makes us meet for life Eternal. If we would live for ever in Bliſs and Glory, we muſt follow after Holineſs; heart and life muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated unto God, elſe Heaven will not be capable to receive us, nor ſhall we be fit to enter in there.</p>

That propenſity cannot be ſeparated from the hatred of ſin, nor that hatred from infinite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude. The <hi>Socinians,</hi> that they might raze Chriſts Satisfaction to the very foundation, deny this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute: This Juſtice, ſay they, is not an Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60626:29"/>in God. Neither is it called <hi>Juſtice</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but rather <hi>Severity,</hi> which is not reſident in God, but only an effect of his Will. But, that there is ſuch an Attribute in God, is evident in Scripture: He is called <gap reason="foreign">

He is ſaid to <hi>be juſt in his judging,</hi> Revel. 16.5. <hi>His judgment is a righteous judgment,</hi> Rom. 2.5. <hi>It is a righteous thing with him to render tribulation,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.6. Puniſhment is called <hi>a juſt Recompence,</hi> Heb. 2.2. Puniſhment, how afflictive ſoever, cannot be Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unleſs Juſtice be declared in it; nor can Juſtice be declared in that, which it requires not. The <hi>Greek</hi> word, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſometimes denotes the <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> Jude v. 7. Sometimes the <hi>Punitive Juſtice</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.4. One <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is from another, juſt Puniſhment iſſues out from Vindictive Juſtice: with reſpect to that only it is, that God is called <hi>a conſuming fire,</hi> Heb. 12.29. As he is Light in his Eſſential Purity, ſo he is Fire in his Eſſential Juſtice, which is ever in Conjunction with his Purity, and, as it were the ardour of it, breaking out in flames of Wrath in ſuch ſort, as ſeems fit to him. Thus Scripture. But further, Nature concurs to make it good. This, that God is Juſt, is graven in the minds of all men: The very <hi>Heathens,</hi> by the indelible Characters which they find there, are able to read the Judgment of God, and ſay, that he hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, a Vengeance that purſued him as a Murderer. The very inſtinct of Nature told them, that there was a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60626:30"/>Connexion between Guilt and Puniſhment. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is <hi>Dei vicarius,</hi> a kind of Repreſentative <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> in men: it hath a ſecret Tribunal in the Heart, and from that Seal and impreſs which divine Juſtice hath ſet upon it, dooms and judges Offenders unto miſery. Hence that ſaying,
<q>
                     <l>—Prima eſt haec ultio, quod ſe</l>
                     <l>Judice, nemo nocens abſolvitur.</l>
                  </q> Puniſhment is coetaneous to Guilt. Sin in its egreſs out of the heart leaves a ſting behind. The Offender cannot be well within, his diſtemper is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a conſcience of his evil-deeds; his mind reflects tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it ſelf: inwardly he is nothing but Wounds and amazing Horrors; the Apparitions of Wrath haunt him; Conſcience is <hi>ſenſus &amp; praejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium judicii divini,</hi> a kind of anticipation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſation of the laſt Judgment. After all this, to deny God to be juſt, is to offer violence to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Nature, and put a lye upon thoſe Notions which are born with, and inſtamped-upon our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: It is to ſay, That the Image and Impreſs of a Deity upon our hearts, is but a Counterfeit; That Conſcience is but a Cheat, and all the Terrors there but a falſe Alarm. In a word, It is to eradicate all Religion, and open a Flood-gate to all wickedneſs and impiety. Theſe being intolerable abſurdities, it cannot but be granted, that there is ſuch an Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute in God: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſaith <hi>Plutarch;</hi> Juſtice follows God, or rather it is his very Eſſence.</p>
               <p>It is an enquiry among Divines, How far it was neceſſary, that ſin ſhould be puniſhed; that without
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60626:30"/>Satisfaction there ſhould be no Remiſſion. It is an indubitable Verity, That it was neceſſary by virtue of Gods Decree: He hath declared himſelf, that he will by no means acquit the guilty. But this is not all. In Scripture, Puniſhment is not attributed meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Will or Decree, but to his juſt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nature; <hi>Thou art righteous, O Lord, becauſe thou haſt judged thus,</hi> Revel. 16.5. Though the mode and circumſtance of Puniſhment be determined by his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign pleaſure, yet the puniſhment it ſelf iſſues out from his Juſtice. Sin merits puniſhment; <hi>They that do ſuch things are worthy of death,</hi> Rom. 1.32. It is not meerly Gods Will, but his Juſtice, which renders unto ſin its due. The proportion which is between Sin and Puniſhment, ſhews who holds the ballance: Were it meerly at the divine Pleaſure to puniſh ſin or not, God need not puniſh obſtinate and impenitent perſons. This the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves cannot bear. They ſay, There is one Juſtice in God,<note place="margin">una<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The other is this, If Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt had not come and ſatisfied for us, all ſinners would have been impenitent and contumacious; the grace of Repentance would never have been given by an unatoned God; neither is it now derived to us, but through a Mediator. <hi>Him hath God exalted
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60626:31"/>with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance,</hi> Acts 5.31. Hence it appears, that without Chriſt, all ſin would have been in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with impenitency, and conſequently neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed. But a little more to clear this Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I ſhall lay down ſome Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Man, a rational Creature, could not be created, but he would immediately by the very frame of his Soul be under a Law. His Reaſon by the innate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Deity, could not but be bound to know the Supreme Truth. His Will by its propenſion to its proper Object, could not but be bound to love the Supreme Goodneſs. The Reſpects, which are in the rational Powers towards their Creator, are a Law never to be altered. God will no more diſſolve them, than he will contradict his own work: Man cannot looſe himſelf from them, which are interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with his immortal Faculties. As long as God is God, the Supreme Truth and Goodneſs; and Man Man, an Intellective and Elective Creature; It muſt needs be indiſpenſably juſt for us to know and love our Creator. The differences of Good and Evil are founded in Nature. The Image of Righteouſneſs is not a movable thing, for then the love of God might be it to day, and by a Counter-motion, the hatred of him might be ſuch to morrow, which is utterly impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Man by his very Creation being under a Law, it could not be otherwiſe but God muſt be a Rector and Judg over him. He that made, muſt rule him; He that put a Law into his Faculties, muſt be his Judg; His Rectitude and Juſtice made him fit to be ſo. Hence that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Is God unrighteous
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60626:31"/>who taketh vengeance? I ſpeak as a man, God forbid; for then how ſhrll God judg the world?</hi> Rom. 3.5, and 6; As if he had ſaid, Unleſs God ceaſe to be Himſelf; unleſs his Righteouſneſs and Juſtice fail, He muſt needs be Judg.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God being Rector and Judg, He muſt needs carry himſelf as becomes one of infinite Rectitude and Juſtice. It is right, that ſin ſhould be puniſhed; <hi>And ſhall not the Judg of all the Earth do right?</hi> After Man, nay all the Race of mankind, had for many Ages turned Rebels againſt God, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and, as much as in them lieth, made void his Sacred Laws: After they had by the contempt of their ſins deſpiſed his Majeſty and Soveraignty, and by the turpitude of them offended his Purity and Holineſs; ſhould all this paſs unpuniſh'd, how black would the Conſequence be? Would it not be a blot to his Government to nod and let fall the reins of Diſcipline? a ſlight to his Law to neglect it as a thing ill-contrived, or unworthy of a Vindication? Would not the great things of the Law appear very ſmall, and the horrible Ataxy of ſin a minute inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nothing? Muſt not the divine Attributes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude and Juſtice be co-ſufferers with that Law, upon whoſe Commands and Comminations their very Image is engraven? Would not the face of things look, as if the moral Foundations, the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of good and evil, were ſhaken and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as if all things were indifferent, and ſin or no ſin, were all one to the Holy One? Which way ſhould his infinite hatred and abhorrence of ſin be manifeſted; no more diſpleaſure outwardly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a world of ſin, than there would at none at
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60626:32"/>all? The total managery of things no way demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating Sin to be odious, or Holineſs grateful; Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience failing, and there being nothing vicarious, no Puniſhment to ſupply the room of it; How could the order between the Creator and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be preſerved? or what would become of that moral dependance and ſubjection which we owe to our Maker? Doubtleſs no defect, no jeofail can be in his Sacred Government. His juſt Anger requires, that Diſcipline ſhould be kept, Manners corrected, and Licentiouſneſs ſuppreſſed. As an Ancient ſpeaks: Man being under a Law,<note place="margin">Surgimus ad vindictam, non quia laſi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ſed ut diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplina ſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, mores cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigantur, licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia comprima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur: haec eſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta ira, quae ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut in homine neceſſaria eſt, ita in Dto, à qno ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem pervenit exemplum. <hi>Lact. de Ira Dei.</hi>
                  </note> God muſt needs be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; and being ſuch, He cannot chuſe but act like himſelf, in a juſt <hi>decorum</hi> to his holy Attributes and Law: No blot or irregularity can light upon his Government. Sin, which makes a breach upon the ſacred Order, muſt be reduced in ſuch a punitive way, as may bear witneſs to his Rectitude and Juſtice. There are two things in Sin; a <hi>Macula,</hi> a corrupting Spot; and a <hi>Reatus,</hi> an obliging Guilt. The Spot is ſuch a Turpitude and ill-temper of mind, that the Soul, in which it is reſident and reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, cannot have Happineſs; the Guilt is ſuch a Chain and ſtrong binder unto Wrath, that the Soul, to which it adheres, cannot have Impunity. The Wiſdom of God ſecures and aſcertains the firſt, Why ſhould not his Juſtice ſecure and aſcertain the ſecond; ſeeing God by the Law of his Eſſence, is as much bound to act in congruity to his Juſtice, as to his Wiſdom?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Upon ſuppoſal that a Puniſhment or Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction were not neceſſary, What ſhould thoſe mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Sacrifices and ſlain Beaſts under the Law
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60626:32"/>mean? If the ſubſtance, the Sacrifice of Chriſt might have been ſpared, what ſhould the types and ſhadows do? Nay, why ſhould the Son of God come, and ſweat, and bleed, and dye upon a Croſs under Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wrath, if all this might have been ſpared? God doth not multiply things without cauſe, much leſs did he make his dear Son the Curſe cauſeleſs. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, <hi>That it was not poſſible that the blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away ſin,</hi> Heb. 10.4. But why ſo? if a meer nothing, a no-ſacrifice might do it? He ſignally diſtinguiſhes; the blood of Beaſts purifies the fleſh, and takes away Ceremonial Guilt. But, which is infinitely more, the blood of Chriſt purges the Conſcience, and takes away real Guilt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14. But will not this diſtinction be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vain, if no blood at all were requiſite to take away guilt? Alſo the Apoſtle aſſerts, <hi>That we are juſtified by Chriſts blood,</hi> Rom. 5.9; But why not without it, if a Satisfaction were unneceſſary? It is very hardly imaginable, that the All-wiſe God ſhould fetch a compaſs, and go round about by his Sons blood, when a word, a merciful pleaſure, might have done the work without it.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, I now proceed to ſhew how Punitive Juſtice was manifeſted in the Sufferings of Chriſt. The Apoſtle ſpeaks memorably, <hi>God ſet forth Chriſt to be a propitiation to declare his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, for the remiſſion of ſins;</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>There could be no remiſſion without it:</hi> and to make it the more emphatical, he doubles the phraſe, <hi>To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, I ſay, at this time his righteouſneſs;</hi> and withal he adds, <hi>That he may be juſt,</hi> Rom. 3.25, 26. Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that is, Punitive Juſtice was eminently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60626:33"/>in the propitiatory Sufferings of Chriſt; unleſs this were ſo, no ſufficient account could be poſſibly given of them. The <hi>Socinians,</hi> who deny Chriſt's Satisfaction, cannot give a tolerable reaſon thereof: For what ſay they? Chriſt in his Sufferings was an example of Patience. I anſwer, he was ſo; but there was a Cloud of ſuffering-Martyrs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Incarnation: and then what ſingular thing was there in his Paſſion? It's true, he was the greateſt Pattern that ever was; but had that been all, why did he ſuffer as our Sponſor and Mediator? why did he bear the Sin of a World, and the Wrath of God due to it? Here he was alone, no man, no Angel was able to trace or follow him. The Saints may fill up the Sufferings of Chriſt in his myſtical body; but they cannot, dare not aſpire ſo far, as to go about to imitate him in thoſe ſatisfactory Ones, which were in his own proper body. Had he been only an exemplary Saviour, he could have ſaved none at all: Not thoſe under the Old Teſtament; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample doth not, like Merit, look backward to thoſe who were before it: Nor thoſe under the New; for no meer Example, no, not that of an Incarnate God, could have raiſed up Man out of the ruins of the Fall, unleſs there had been in his Sufferings a Satisfaction to Juſtice. The Guilt of Sin could not have been done away, unleſs there had been therein a Merit to procure the Holy Spirit. The Power of Sin could not have been ſubdued; a meer exemplary Chriſt would have been but a titular Saviour. The great deſign of raiſing up a Church out of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Maſs of Mankind would have failed, a Pattern only being too weak a bottom for it to ſtand upon.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60626:33"/>Again they ſay, Chriſt ſuffered, that he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Covenant with his own blood. I anſwer, the Covenant was confirmed in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. It was made immutable by Gods Word and Oath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. It was ratified by the glorious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Chriſt; it was ſealed up by the precious blood of Martyrs: and why muſt the Son of God dye for it? or if he muſt, might not a ſimple death ſerve? Why was there a Curſe, and an horrible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion upon him? There can be no imaginable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence or connexion between his bearing the tokens of Gods Wrath, and his confirming the Covenant of Grace; the one can have no congruity or ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to the other. The Scripture therefore, which gives a better account, tells us that he dyed to pay a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Ranſom for us; obtain eternal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aboliſh and make an end of ſin; deliver from the world, and the wrath to come; reconcile to God, purchaſe a Church, and bring in everlaſting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and an happy Immortality ſuitable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Theſe noble and excellent ends could not be compaſſed, but by Sufferings penal and ſatisfactory, ſuch as had the bitter ingredients of Divine Wrath and diſpleaſure in them. Chriſt was not a meer Witneſs, but a Prieſt, Redeemer, and Mediator: His blood was not only <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Teſtimony, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Propitiation; neither was it only confirmative of the Covenant, but fundative: all the Promiſes of Grace and Glory ſprung up out of his ſatisfactory and meritorious Paſſion. Further they ſay, that in his Sufferings the immenſe Love of God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted. I anſwer, His immenſe Love was indeed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Illuſtrious in giving his Son; but to what purpoſe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60626:34"/>was he given, but to be a Propitiation? <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>In this was love, that he ſent his Son to be a propitiation for our ſins,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. When inexorable Juſtice-ſtood as an Obſtacle in the way; when Satisfaction muſt be made, or mankind eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally periſh; then infinite Love appeared in giving the only begotten Son to be an expiatory ſacrifice for us, to ſatisfie Juſtice, that we might partake of Mercy. But if a Satisfaction were needleſs, if the Sufferings of Chriſt might have been ſpared; Where is the vehemence of Love? It may ſeem rather to be in Remiſſion of ſin, than in the Paſſion of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. That Remiſſion ſhould come to us through his intervenient Death, when that Death was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, looks not ſo much like an act of Love, as of Sapience: and yet how Sapience ſhould unneceſſarily, and without juſt cauſe, order ſo great a thing as the Death of Chriſt to be, I cannot underſtand. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they ſay, Chriſt ſuffered, that his Death inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, we might be aſſured by his Reſurrection, of our own, and of life eternal to be obtained in a way of Obedience. But I anſwer, This is rather to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the end of Chriſts Reſurrection, than of his Death: for his Death here comes in only by the by, as a meer intervenient thing, <hi>a cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> a thing which hath no proper end of its own. It is not to me imaginable, that ſuch an one as he was, ſhould dye meerly to teſtifie to thoſe things, which were before fecured by the immutable Word and Oath of God himſelf. <hi>O beatos nos, quorum cauſâ Deus jurat! miſeros, ſi ne juranti credimus!</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian:</hi> his Oath cannot but be a ſufficient ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It's true, Chriſts Death and Reſurrection do
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60626:34"/>aſſure Believers, that they ſhall riſe and live for ever in Glory: But how do they do it? what, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily only? no ſurely, his Death was ſatisfactory for ſin, and meritorious of life eternal. His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection was a Seal, a pregnant proof, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction made by his Death was full and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. Hence ariſes in Believers an aſſurance of Life and Immortality, the ſame being purchaſed and paid for by the blood of Jeſus. Had his Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection been exemplary only, which way ſhould an aſſurance be drawn from it? The argument, if any, muſt run after ſome ſuch rate as this: Jeſus Chriſt, God as well as Man, one having Power over his own life, free from all ſin, never ſeeing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, able to overcome death it ſelf, did riſe from the grave; <hi>Ergo,</hi> meer men, having no power over their lives, tainted with ſin, ſubject to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unable to conquer death, ſhall riſe alſo: the inconſequence is apparent. On the other hand let the argument run thus: Jeſus Chriſt did by a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of infinite Merit and Satisfaction, purchaſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life for Believers; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they ſhall be ſure to have it: here the conſequence muſt needs be ſure and infallible. Upon the whole matter it appears, that no tolerable account can be given of Chriſts Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, unleſs Juſtice were ſatisfied and declared therein. But to explicate this more diſtinctly, I ſhall a little conſider three things:
<list>
                     <item>1. God the great Rector, who inflicted thoſe Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings on Chriſt.</item>
                     <item>2. Chriſt the Patient, who bore them.</item>
                     <item>3. The Sufferings in themſelves, and in their fruits.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:60626:35"/>
               <p n="1">1. God, the righteous Rector, who inflicted them, was one of infinite Mercy. Mercy in men, though but finite, is ſometimes a <hi>remora</hi> to puniſhment. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a juſt, that is (as the word there muſt be taken) a merciful man, would not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, make <hi>Mary</hi> a publick ſpectacle of Juſtice, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.19. But though God were one of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mercy, and that not meerly reſident in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but as it were in motion, triumphantly going forth in a moſt compaſſionate deſign towards man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; yet he would have Juſtice ſatisfied in the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his Son: <hi>To declare, I ſay, at this time his righteouſneſs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. Obſerve, it was at this time, it was then a day of Salvation, a Jubilee of Redemption to Mankind; yet for all that, Juſtice muſt have its due, and be declared in the Sufferings of Chriſt. But here the <hi>Socinians</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, That infinite Juſtice, and infinite Mercy are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites, and cannot both be together in God; or if they were, God, who cannot act contrary to any thing in his Nature, could neither puniſh becauſe of his Mercy, nor yet pardon becauſe of his Juſtice. But I anſwer, Mercy and Juſtice are not oppoſites in Man. After the Idolatry of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Molten Calf, <hi>Moſes</hi> would in Juſtice have every one ſlay his Brother; yet in an high exceſs of Mercy and Charity he would pray, <hi>Forgive their ſin; if not, blot me out of thy book,</hi> Exod. 32.27, &amp; 32. Neither are they oppoſites in God, when he proclaims his Name in thoſe ſtately Titles; <hi>The Lord merciful, gracious, long-ſuffering, abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, and tranſgreſſion, and ſin:</hi> He yet adds in the cloſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60626:35"/>of all, <hi>That he will by no means clear the guilty,</hi> Exod. 34.6, 7. Mercy and Juſtice in God have different objects: the Penitents, who partake of Mercy, are not the objects of Juſtice; the Impenitents, who feel Juſtice, are not the objects of Mercy. Yet theſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are not contrary the one to the other; being both Divine Perfections, they can no more be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the one to the other, than the Divine Eſſence, which both of them are, can be contrary to it ſelf. Cruelty, not Juſtice, is oppoſite to Mercy; Injuſtice, not Mercy, is oppoſite to Juſtice. Neither doth God in pardoning or puniſhing, act contrary to any thing in his Nature. In pardoning Penitents, he acts not againſt his Juſtice, for that was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in their Sponſor Jeſus Chriſt: In puniſhing Impenitents, he acts not againſt his Mercy; for that, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves confeſs, extends not to obſtinate ſinners, neither are they at all capable of it. Theſe two Attributes do mutually illuſtrate one another: the Mercy of God is the more Illuſtrious, becauſe when Juſtice was inexorable, it ſent his Son to ſuffer for us. The Juſtice of God is the more glorious in Chriſts Sufferings, becauſe they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by one whoſe Mercy was infinite in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in his deſign towards Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt the Patient, who bore thoſe Sufferings, may be conſidered under divers reſpects, each of which ſhew Juſtice to be Illuſtrious in his Sufferings. Take him as Man, Juſtice appears, in that the penal Sufferings were in the ſame nature which had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The nature of Angels was not aſſumed, the facrifice of Beaſts would not ſerve the turn, neither had the ſame nature with man; but that Juſtice
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60626:36"/>might be exact, that the Sufferings might be in the ſame nature which had ſinned, the Son of God was made fleſh, and ſuffered in it as an expiatory Sacrifice for us. Notable is that of the Prophet, <hi>All their wickedneſs is in Gilgal, there I hated them,</hi> Hoſ. 9.15. Sin was found in the humane Nature, and there it muſt be puniſhed. Take him as the Son of God, Juſtice appears, in that ſo great, ſo dear a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuffered for us. <hi>David</hi> ſpared <hi>Joab,</hi> becauſe he was a great, a potent man in the Army. And <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom,</hi> becauſe he was a dearly beloved Son. In the former he ſaid, <hi>The Sons of</hi> Zerviah <hi>are too hard for me:</hi> and in the latter, <hi>Deal gently with the young man.</hi> But though Jeſus Chriſt was very great, God, and Gods Fellow, <hi>one who thought it no robbery to be equal with God;</hi> though he was very dear, a Son, and an only begotten, the Fathers eſſential Image, and eternal joy: Yet for all this, ſtanding in the room of ſinners, he muſt not be ſpared. It was a great Wrath in <hi>Henry</hi> the Second of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thuan.</hi> l. 20.564.</note> which made him by a paſſionate throw to ſmite, though but occaſionally, his own Son then ſitting at his feet. But oh! how great, how wonderful was the Juſtice of God in Chriſts Sufferings, when no greatneſs, no dearneſs, though infinite, did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate or turn away the ſtroke? When he bruiſed and wounded to death his own Son, and that inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, and on purpoſe to vindicate the Honour of his Juſtice and Law? In other puniſhments he falls but upon meer Creatures; but here, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence be it ſpoken, He falls upon himſelf; the Son of God, very God, (and a dearer or greater perſon there could not be) was the ſufferer. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60626:36"/>take him as an holy Innocent One; Juſtice, which uſually hath only to do with ſinners, will yet appear. He was Holineſs it ſelf, in his Divine Nature: He was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, in his Humane; yet, if he will ſtand as a Surety for mankind, he cannot be excuſed. It is obſervable in Scripture, that penal Sufferings ſtay not meerly at the offenders door, but run over upon thoſe in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with him. <hi>Achan</hi> ſinned in the accurſed thing, and his Sons and Daughters were ſtoned, and buried with fire. <hi>David</hi> ſinned in numbring the people, and no leſs than ſeventy thouſand ſubjects fell by a Peſtilence. But the Holy Jeſus is an inſtance above all others: their Sufferings fell indeed upon Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet ſtill upon ſinners; here they fell upon the Holy One. Juſtice is illuſtrious, when ſinners ſuffer in conjunction with ſinners; but how highly doth it act, when Innocency it ſelf ſuffers in conjunction with them; I mean, as a Sponſor on their behalf? But here the <hi>Socinians</hi> cry out,<note place="margin">Nibil divinae juſtitiae magis contrarium eſt, quàm inſontem ſontis loco puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, <hi>Volk. de Sat.</hi> Quid hoe aliud eſt, quam ſaevum tyrannum facere? <hi>Sclict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. cont.

                  </note> That if God ſhould pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the innocent for the guilty, Chriſt for us Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he would be unjuſt, a cruel Tyrant, one like <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who looked upon a ditch full of Humane blood, as a fair ſpectacle. Unto which I anſwer, the Scripture is very pregnant; our ſins were laid upon him, they were condemned in his fleſh, he bore them in his body: he was wounded and bruiſed for them, and that even unto death, and that not a meer ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple death, but one that had a penal curſe in it. And if theſe phraſes expreſs not puniſhment, no words can do it. Yet for all this, corrupt Reaſon is ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that rather than ſubſcribe to the Sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, it will blaſpheme and call God Tyrant. Indeed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60626:37"/>an innocent cannot be puniſhed for the guilty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſorily, but Chriſt ſuffered by conſent: <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God,</hi> Heb. 10.7. The Law of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was in his heart, <hi>he gave himſelf for us, an offering, and a ſacrifice,</hi> Eph. 5.2. And what is freer than Gift? or what colour of Injuſtice can there be in ſuch a Suffering? The Reaſon and Juſtice of all Nations agree in this, that one may by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be puniſhed for another. It's true, he cannot juſtly conſent to ſuffer in that which he hath not a juſt power over. Men have not ſuch a power over their lives, as they have over their eſtates. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blemiſh in the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of old, who engaged life for life, was this, That they had not a juſt power over their lives to give them as a Compenſation for others; but Chriſt might juſtly conſent, he had power over his own life: <hi>I have power,</hi> ſaith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to lay down my life, and authority to take it up again,</hi> Joh. 10.18. Hence it appears, that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuffer puniſhment for us, was a very juſt valid one, it being in that, which he had authority over; and where there is ſuch a juſt conſent, there an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent one may ſuffer for the guilty. It's true, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent one meerly as ſuch cannot be puniſhed; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did our Saviour ſuffer as ſuch, but as one in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with us, as our <hi>Goel</hi> and Sponſor, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to bear the puniſhment of our ſins. It could not be unjuſt for him to undertake it; and after un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, it could not but be juſt for him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it; eſpecially, ſeeing his perſon could not ſink under his Sufferings, and his Sufferings could not be in vain, or to no purpoſe. He roſe as a glorious Victor, and out of his Penal Evils ſprung that great
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60626:37"/>Good, the Redemption of a World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Sufferings of Chriſt are to be conſidered in themſelves, and in their fruits. Take them in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Juſtice appears in the proportionableneſs of them: in puniſhing Juſtice holds the Ballance, it weighs and meaſures out Penal Evils for Moral: Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Sinners are called, <hi>the portion of their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> Jer. 13.25. as being inflicted in a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now the Sufferings of Chriſt were proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in divers reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was a proportion between the ſeats of Suffering in Chriſt, and the ſeats of Sin in us. Man ſinned in his body, Sin was organically and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally there; proportionably Chriſt ſuffered in his body, no part of it but was racked upon a torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Croſs: becauſe our Corporeal Parts had been wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of Iniquity, Juſtice made his the ſubjects of Miſery. Man ſinned in his Soul, there was the prime and chief ſeat of Sin; proportionably Chriſt ſuffered in his Soul; nay, there was the prime and chief ſeat of Suffering: becauſe the main reſidence and venom of ſin was in our Souls, the greateſt preſſure, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of wrath was upon his. He was exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, even to death; He was ſore amazed, and as it were fainted away; yea, for very anguiſh he ſweat drops of blood, and upon the Croſs, cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> All this befel him, who was fortitude and conſtancy it ſelf. Under the Law, Juſtice had eye for eye, tooth for tooth, wound for wound, ſtripe for ſtripe; in Jeſus Chriſt it had a Suffering body and ſoul, as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the ſinning bodies and ſouls of Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was a proportion between the Penal Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60626:38"/>in Chriſt, and thoſe in the threatning of the Law. Chriſt ſuffered not the very <hi>Idem,</hi> neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could he do ſo; becauſe there was a change of perſon, and in ſtrictneſs, <hi>Si alius ſolvit, alind ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitur:</hi> but his Sufferings came as near to thoſe in the Law, as could poſſibly ſtand with a juſt <hi>decorum</hi> to his Sacred Perſon; as little was abated as might be. This will appear by the many ſteps of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He, the Son of God, very God, aſſumed our frail Nature. But might this infinite and wonderful Condeſcenſion ſatisfie Juſtice for the ſin of the world? no, He muſt be under the Law, and fulfil all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Well, that being done, might that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (wherein ſo high an Honour was reflected upon the Law, as that it was obeyed perfectly in all things, and that by its Maker) ſatisfie for ſin? No, that alone was not enough, there muſt be ſhedding of blood, or no Remiſſion. But if there muſt be blood, might not a few drops of his blood, the ſame being of an infinite value, do the work? No, the Law calls for Death, without that he could not be an expiatory Sacrifice for us. But if a Death muſt be, might not a ſimple one, being of ſo great a perſon, ſerve the turn? No, the Law pronounces a Curſe, and that he was made, the marks and tokens of Wrath were upon him: and why all this, but that God would have his Sufferings comply, and come as near the terms of the Law as might be? It's true, he did not bear the accidentals of puniſhment, his Sufferings were not eternal; but in the Law puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is eternal, only as it relates to a finite Creature, which can never ſatisfie, but not as it relates to a mighty Sponſor, who could pay down all at once,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60626:38"/>and ſwallow up death in Victory. He ſuffered not the worm of Conſcience, or Deſperation: But the firſt of theſe is from Sin, inherent, and putrifying in Conſcience; and the ſecond from the Imbecillity of of the Creature, ſinking under its burden, neither of which could be in him. He bore not the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals of puniſhment; but as great a perſon as he was, the eſſentials could not be abated. There was in his Sufferings <hi>Paena ſenſûs,</hi> when the fire of wrath melted him into a bloody ſweat; and <hi>paena damni,</hi> when the Eclipſe of favour made him cry out of forſaking. Though God in his Soveraignty would relax the Law, and introduce his own Son, as a Sponſor to ſatisfie for us; yet his Son ſtanding in that capacity, He would in Juſtice have him ſuffer as near the penalty in the Law as could be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was a proportion between the Sufferings of Chriſt, and the Sin of a World. Sin is an infinite evil; and his Sufferings, to compenſate it, were of an infinite value. Sufferings are not to be eſtimated as money, which, in whoſe hands ſoever it be, is one and the ſame; but according to the Dignity of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Hence that of the people to <hi>David, Thou art worth ten thouſand of us,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.3. Hence that <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Proverb, uſed to <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thuat.</hi> l. 42.446.</note> to move him to ſeize upon the chief Proteſtants: <hi>One Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons head is more worth than the heads of fifty Frogs.</hi> In the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, puniſhments are varied according to the condition of Perſons. Free-men were not under the ſame puniſhments as ſervants. The <hi>Lex Porcia</hi> would not leave Rods upon the back of a Free-man: the Sufferings of a Prince and a private man, are not to be valued at the ſame rate. At the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60626:39"/>Death of <hi>Abner, David</hi> took ſpecial notice of it, and cryed out, <hi>A Prince, a great man is fallen this day in Iſrael,</hi> 2 Sam. 3.38. The Sufferings of great men are very eſtimable; What then are the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a God, ſuch as our Saviour? The Scripture is very emphatical in ſetting forth this to us: <hi>God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the Church with his own blood,</hi> Acts 20.28. <hi>God laid down his life for us,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.16. <hi>The Lord of Glory was crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. <hi>The man Gods fellow was ſmitten,</hi> Zach. 13.7. <hi>He offered up himſelf through the eternal ſpirit,</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>The Prince of life was killed,</hi> Acts 3.15. His Deity ſtamped an infinite value upon his Sufferings, ſuch as made them a full Compenſation for the ſin of a world. That therefore of <hi>Socinus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quicquid paſſus eſt Chriſtus, nullam majorem vim per ſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere poteſt, quam ſi quilibet purus homo idem paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus eſſet. <hi>De ſervatore, pars 3. cap. 4.</hi>
                  </note> that the Sufferings of Chriſt have no more virtue in themſelves, than if a meer man had ſuffered, is no leſs than horrible blaſphemy, and for ever to be abhorred by us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There was a proportion between the Sufferings of Chriſt, and the Sufferings of a world. <hi>One dyed for all,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. But what an one was he? No leſs than very God: his Deity ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated his Sufferings into a kind of infinity. Upon this account his Sufferings, though but the Sufferings of one,<note place="margin">Unum ſi multiplices, habthis tandem numirum omnium hominum; omnium verò bominum collectio, quantum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cun<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> multiplicetur, nunquam Chriſti potentiam, authoritatem, dignitatem, ſapientiam, ſanctitatem, deitatem aequabit, <hi>Theſ. Salmur. de paſſ. Chriſti.</hi>
                  </note> did equalize, nay, ſuperexceed the Sufferings of a world. For as the <hi>French</hi> Divines have obſerved; if you multiply one, you ſhall at laſt have the number of all men: but a Collection of all men, however mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, will never equal the Power,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60626:39"/>Authority, Dignity, Wiſdom, Sanctity, and Deity of Chriſt. In the Sufferings of a world, every ſufferer would have been but a meer Creature; but in his Sufferings, the ſufferer was no leſs than God himſelf. Here therefore Juſtice appears more ſignally, than if all the world had ſuffered, and that for ever. His Sufferings, though but Temporary, did more than counterpoiſe the eternal Sufferings of a world. Should we ſuppoſe, which is impoſſible, that all men had paid and paſſed through eternal Sufferings, thoſe would have delivered them from the Curſe of the Law; the Sufferings of Chriſt (which ſhews their Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency, and more) produce the ſame effect, and over and above merit life eternal. There is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble order in puniſhing: The order of Juſtice would have a puniſhment infinite in Magnitude; but becauſe a finite Creature cannot bear it, the order of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will have it infinite in Duration. But as the <hi>French</hi> Divines have obſerved,<note place="margin">Theſ. Salm. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſ. Sat.</note> Chriſt being ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in our room, the order of Juſtice returns again. Our Saviours Sufferings were of an infinite value, the ſum of Sufferings was paid down all at once. In theſe therefore Juſtice is more Illuſtrious, than it could have been in eternal Ones; wherein mere fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Creatures would have been ever a paying a little, and a little, but could never have ſatisfied Divine Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Thus the Sufferings of Chriſt in themſelves, do by their excellent proportionableneſs manifeſt the Juſtice of God; but beſides, the conſequents and fruits of them, ſhew the fulneſs of his Satisfaction to that Juſtice. And theſe may be conſidered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Chriſt himſelf, or elſe with reſpect to us.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60626:40"/>
               <p>As to Chriſt himſelf, What were the conſequents of his Sufferings? The pains of death were looſed, as not able to hold ſuch a Satisfier as he was; <hi>He was taken from priſon,</hi> Iſa. 53.8. as having diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all: He had an acquittance in his Reſurrection, as a ſure proof, that he had made full payment in his death: <hi>The God of peace brought him again from the dead,</hi> Heb. 13.20. Obſerve, it was the God of Peace. Firſt, the Divine Juſtice was appeaſed, and then the Divine Power raiſed him up. He had all the Power in Heaven, and in Earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, as an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible witneſs, that he had by his Blood reconciled all things there. He aſcended, and entred into the true Sanctuary, into Heaven it ſelf; and this tells us, that the expiatory and ſatisfactory blood was ſhed before in his Death: He <hi>appears in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9.24; and that aſſures us, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Anger is over: <hi>having by himſelf purged our ſins, he ſate down at the right hand of the Majeſty on high,</hi> Heb. 1.3. His ſatisfactory-work was perfectly done, and then he reſted in ſtate. All theſe glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents make it appear, that his Satisfaction was a plenary one.</p>
               <p>As to us, the fulneſs of his Satisfaction appears, in that Juſtice hath nothing at all to demand from ſuch as are in him, and by Faith become myſtical parts and pieces of him; the atoning Blood is upon them, and the damning Law paſſes over them. Thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>There is no condemnation to thoſe which are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8.1. The Apoſtle ſaith not, that there is <hi>nihil condemnabile,</hi> for the reliques of ſin are in them: but he ſaith, there is <hi>nulla con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnatio,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:60626:40"/>no condemnation to them; for the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction applied, cleanſes away ſin, and delivers from Wrath. It's true, Believers may have afflictions; but what are they? They are only Caſtigatory, and for their good; not Vindictive, or for the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Juſtice. Again, the fulneſs of his Satisfaction appears, in that his Sufferings were not meerly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, but redundantly meritorious. Theſe have opened Heaven, as well to let down thoſe influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Crace to us, which, unleſs Juſtice had been appeaſed, would never have fallen upon us, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce us into that life and bleſſed Immortality which we guilty and defiled Creatures, while ſuch, could not be capable of. We ſee here, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of our Saviour was not a poor, ſhort, or ſcanty thing; but good meaſure, preſſed down, and running over in the purchaſe of all good things for us.</p>
               <p>It was a good ſaying, <hi>Vulnera Chriſti ſunt biblia practica,</hi> the Sufferings of Chriſt, in which Juſtice ſo eminently appears, are a ſtrong Motive to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; enough, if duly conſidered, to ſet all men a weeping over their iniquities: What, did the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſuffer? Was the Lord of Glory crucified? Was the bleſſed One made a Curſe? Did the Son of God, very God, ſo dear, ſo great a perſon, ſweat, bleed, cry out, and expire upon a tormenting Croſs, and all this to take away ſin? What a ſpectacle is this? Who can look upon it with dry eyes, or an unmelt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart? When the Son of God was broken, ſhould our hearts be untouched? May we ſpare our tears, when he parted with his blood? To look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his wounds, and not mourn over our ſins, can be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60626:41"/>no leſs than unnatural hardneſs. Oh! what a thing is ſin? how horrible, how infinite an evil, that it could not be expiated at an eaſier rate, than the blood of God himſelf? What Plea can be made, or colour given for ſo vile a thing, that it ſhould have a Being in the world, or ſo much as a reſidence in an humane Thought? Should that be indulged which coſt Jeſus Chriſt ſo dear? or that go free, which nailed him to the Croſs? Canſt thou love that which ſtabbed him at the heart? or live in that for which he dyed? May that be light, which preſſed him into an agony and bloody-ſweat? or that ſweet, which put ſo much Gall and Vinegar into his Cup? Canſt thou bleſs thy ſelf in that which made him a Curſe? or follow after that which made him cry out of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking? Think, and again think, if thy blind eyes and hard heart will let thee, what, and how dreadful a thing it is for thee to go on in thine iniquities. In ſo doing, thou doſt not meerly run upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Soveraignty of the Almighty, but upon the wounds and blood of thy dear Saviour, impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly trampling them under thy impure feet: and how grievous a thing is this? If thou art fearleſs, and ſtoppeſt not here, what hope canſt thou have? It becomes thee to ſit down and lament that helliſh <hi>impetus</hi> in thy own heart, which moves ſwiftly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Hell, without admitting any <hi>remora.</hi> A few words from God gave check to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Gen. 20. And ſhall not the wounds and blood of thy dear Lord do as much to thee? The ſword of an Angel put a ſtop to <hi>Balaam</hi> in his perverſe way, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. And wilt thou go on, who haſt ſeen the ſword of God drawn againſt the Man, his fellow, for thine iniquities? If the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60626:41"/>groans of the Creatures, all round about, ſounding in thine ears, did not ſtartle thee, yet ſhouldeſt thou be deaf and ſenſleſs to the Sufferings of thy Saviour, bleeding and dying upon a Croſs, in compariſon of which the daſhing down of a world is a poor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? If the breaches of the Sacred Law, dearer to God than Heaven and Earth, do not move thee, yet wilt thou not be moved, when thou ſeeſt that amazing ſight, God for our ſins bruiſing and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son, his eſſential Image, in our aſſumed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? If thou doſt not bluſh at the blots and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitudes which ſin hath made in thy own ſoul, yet methinks it ſhould deeply affect thee, that the Son of God was made ſin and a Curſe for thee. Should God let thee down to Hell, and after ſome ſcorches from the fire unquenchable, take thee up again, wouldeſt thou yet go on in ſin? no ſurely; and why wilt thou do it now, after thou haſt ſeen ſuch a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Juſtice in the Lord Jeſus, as more than coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervails the Sufferings of a world? When a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation approaches, How is it that thou ſeeſt not the price of blood writ upon it? Which way doſt thou forget the nails and bloody Croſs of thy Redeemer? Thou ſeeſt plainly, that God is ae juſt, a righteous One; and for a full proof of it, he hath written Juſtice in red Letters, in the Paſſion of his own Son; if thou run on in thy ſins, how, which way canſt thou eſcape? God ſpared not his own Son, ſtanding in our room, and will he ſpare thee in thy impenitent ſinning? Wrath fell very ſeverely upon the Holy, Innocent, meek Lamb of God: and will it paſs over thee, wallowing in thy filthy luſts and corruptions? What, did God exact ſo great a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60626:42"/>for ſin, that it might be allowed? Did he vindicate his broken Law at ſo high a rate, that it might be more broken, and that with Impunity? 'Tis utterly impoſſible: thoſe Sufferings of Chriſt which did witneſs Gods hatred of Sin, could not open a gap to it: the Surety did not ſweat, pray, bleed, and dye under Wrath, that the impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner might be ſpared. O how profane and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous is ſuch a thought, which makes the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer a Patron of iniquity! He came to ſave us from our ſins, not in them; to redeem from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, not to encourage it; What then? where is thy hope, O impenitent ſinner? Is it in Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? As infinite as it is, it will not let out a drop to the impenitent, neither indeed can it do ſo, unleſs, which is impoſſible, one Attribute can croſs another; Mercy can reproach Holineſs or Juſtice. Believe it, Salvation it ſelf cannot ſave thee in thy ſins: Is it in Chriſt and his Merits? He is the Saviour of the Body, but thou art out of it. He is the Author of eternal Salvation to them that obey him: but thou art a Rebel. May Chriſt be divided? Canſt thou have a part in his Prieſtly office, who art in Arms daily againſt his Kingly? Shall the Promiſes comfort thee, who caſteſt off the Righteous Commands? It cannot be. What Concord hath Chriſt with <hi>Belial?</hi> How ill-ſuited are an hard heart and a bleeding Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? How canſt thou truſt in that Jeſus, whom thou deſpiſeſt, and crucifieſt afreſh by thy Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? or depend on his Merits, when thou liveſt in enmity againſt his Divine Spirit and Life? Theſe are meer inconſiſtencies. Thy caſe, while
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60626:42"/>thou art in thy ſins, is very forlorn and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. God will be a conſuming fire to thee; thy ſelf muſt be as dry ſtubble before him; every luſt will be a never-dying worm; thy ſoul will furiouſly reflect upon it ſelf for its prodigious folly; abuſed Mercy will turn into fury. Chriſt, the great Saviour, will doom thee to perdition; fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt will be rained down upon thee, and that for ever. If then thou haſt any fear of God, or love to thy ſelf, caſt away thy tranſgreſſions, and return to him, that thou mayeſt eſcape the Wrath to come, and enjoy the pure beatitudes which are in Heaven.</p>

The Love and Mercy of God an excellent Motive to ſtir up our Love towards God and Man.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAVING ſpoken of Gods Juſtice, I now proceed to his Love, Mercy, and Grace. Theſe are eminently aſcribed to him in Scripture: <hi>He is love it ſelf,</hi> 1 John 4.16. eſſentially ſuch. <hi>He is the Father of mercies,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3. Mercy is his off-ſpring and joy. <hi>He is the God of all grace,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.10. The fountain of it is in him, and all Graces in the Creature iſſue from thence. Love communicates good to the Creature. Mercy communicates it to the Creature in miſery. Grace communicates it to a Creature, though unworthy. All the drops and meaſures of goodneſs in the Creature, are from Love: when the good is ſuited to the miſery of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 'tis Mercy; when it exceeds deſert, and as it were triumphs over unworthineſs, 'tis Grace in a ſpecial manner. I ſhall not diſcourſe of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, but, as the uſage in Scripture is, promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60626:43"/>theſe are in a very ſignal manner manifeſted in Chriſt. So admirable a Glaſs is he, that not only Wiſdom, Holineſs, and Juſtice are repreſented in him; but Love, Mercy and Grace alſo. In theſe it is that this wonderful Occonomy terminates. Wiſdom laid the plot, Holineſs and Juſtice appeared in our Saviours Paſſion, but the Center of all is Grace and Mercy. Theſe are highly exalted in the Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation of Men.</p>
               <p>The firſt appearance of theſe ſtands in this, That God did not ſtand upon the firſt terms, upon the Old Covenant of Works: God made <hi>Adam</hi> a very knowing and righteous Creature, he gave him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Laws, Moral ones inſcribed in his heart; and over and above, one poſitive Law in the Tree of knowledg: He entred into a Covenant with him, as the head and root of all mankind; the terms were, That all his Poſterity ſhould ſtand or fall in him. He tranſgreſſed the Command of God, and ſo Sin and Death came upon all the humane World. Here God might have ſtood upon the firſt terms; he was not bound to make new ones, but might have ſtood upon the old, and proſecuted them to the utter ruin of all Mankind. This is plain by theſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Laws given by God to <hi>Adam</hi> were ſuch, as became God to give, and <hi>Adam</hi> to receive, very juſt and righteous. The Moral Ones were congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to his holy Faculties, and conducible to his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: they were interwoven into his very rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Powers, and Obedience might have come forth in the eaſineſs of his Holy Principles. The poſitive one was a juſt one. God, who made Man Lord of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60626:44"/>the lower World, might well except one Tree, as a token of his Supreme Soveraignty, when the thing forbidden was not a thing in it ſelf evil, but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. Gods Authority appears the more Sacred, and Mans Obedience would have been the more pure; the Tree, as lovely to the eyes, was a fit curb to the ſenſitive appetite. And as a Tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg was a juſt reſtraint to intellectual curioſity, the prohibition of ſuch a Tree was an excellent <hi>Item</hi> to man to look to both faculties; the terms were juſt, not only as to himſelf, but as to his poſterity. Had not God made them, he would never have told us, that all ſinned in one; and that by one, judgment came upon all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, &amp; 18. Which, without ſuch terms, would have been impoſſible; and if he made them, it was no leſs impoſſible that they ſhould be unjuſt. <hi>Adam</hi> was the root and head of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; we were in him naturally as latent in his loins, and legally as compriſed within the Covenant. His Perſon was the fountain of ours, and his Will the repreſentative of ours. The thing therefore was equal: unjuſt Laws ſhould be abrogated; but in this caſe, the Laws and Terms being Righteous, God might have ſtood ſtrictly upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Adam</hi> having holy Powers, ſufficient for Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, was bound to keep them with all diligence: that, which was formerly ſpoken to the Church in <hi>Thyatira, Hold faſt that which thou haſt,</hi> Rev. 2.25. was virtually ſpoken to <hi>Adam:</hi> Nature dictates, that Duty ſhould be returned where benefits are received. The Law of fidelity requires, that a Truſtee ſhould keep the <hi>depoſitum.</hi> God intruſted man with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent endowments; but if he will by his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60626:44"/>caſt them away, muſt God make them good? Muſt he follow after a Rebel, a waſting bankrupt Creature, to repair the loſt Image, and ſet him up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with a new ſtock of Grace? No: He, who made him <hi>ex beneplacito,</hi> cannot be bound <hi>ex juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ,</hi> to new-frame him, being broken; He might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſpot of injuſtice, have left all mankind in the ruins of the Fall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The caſe of the fallen Angels determines this point: When they left their Principle, or firſt Eſtate, Did God capitulate, or enter into new Articles with them? Was there a <hi>tabula poſt naufragium,</hi> a room for Faith or Repentance? Had they a Chriſt, or a Goſpel tendred unto them? No, they were caſt down immediately into chains of darkneſs. The ſentence was irreverſible, their miſery eternal; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation would have been a kind of favour to them. That God, who ſtood upon the firſt terms with Angels, ſuperior creatures, might have done ſo with man, being a little lower than thoſe glorious Creatures. I know there are differences aſſigned between the two Caſes. Angels were the firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, the ring-leaders in ſin: Man followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Angels had a moſt pure light, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any allay of fleſh: Mans intellect was lower, and in conjunction with matter. The Angels ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſelf-motion, and of their own meerly: Man ſinned by ſeduction, and through the guile of the Serpent. In the Fall of Angels, all the Angelical nature fell not: In <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, all the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fell, no Religion was left in the lower world. But not withſtanding all this, God might in Juſtice have ſtood upon the firſt terms with Man, as well as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60626:45"/>with Angels; and that he did not do ſo, it was from meer Grace, as the primary Reaſon thereof.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Grace is in a very eminent manner lifted up in the Goſpel. Grace gives Chriſt, and Faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him. Grace juſtifies and ſanctifies. Grace faves and crowns with a bleſſed Immortality. Every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the Goſpel ſounds forth, Grace, Grace; but if God might not juſtly have ſtood upon the old terms, the giving of new ones to Man, was not Grace, but Debt; not Mercy, but Juſtice. Thoſe <hi>Novatores,</hi> who ſay, That it would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt for God to have condemned <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity for the firſt Sin, do thereby overturn the Grace of the Goſpel. The Apoſtle, who is much rather to be believed, ſaith expreſly, <hi>That by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation,</hi> Rom. 5.18; that is, according to the terms of the old Covenant; but if the old terms might not have been ſtood upon, the new ones muſt be neceſſary and due to mankind, and ſo no Grace at all. They who deny the Juſtice of the old Covenant, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Grace of the new.</p>
               <p>God, as we ſee, might have ſtood upon the old terms, even to the utter ruin of fallen mankind. But, oh! immenſe Love! He would not; he would do ſo with. Angels, but he would not with Men; an abatement was made to them, not afforded to thoſe nobler Creatures; once Inmates of Heaven. In the caſe of <hi>Sadow,</hi> God came down lower and lower, from fifty righteous perſons, to forty five; and ſo at laſt to ten, <hi>I will not do it for tens ſake,</hi> Gen. 18.32. But in the caſe of fallen man, when all had ſinned, when there was none righteous, no, not one;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60626:45"/>God comes down from the firſt terms made with Man, to ſuch lower ones as might comply with his frailty. Under the Law there were Sacrifices called by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, <hi>Gnoleh najored,</hi> aſcending, and deſcending. The rich man offered a Lamb, the poor, whoſe hand could not reach ſo far, offered two Turtle-Doves. While Man was rich in Holy Powers and Excellencles, God called for pure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſinleſs Obedience; but after the Fall, he being poor in Spirituals, altogether unable to pay ſuch a ſum, God ſtoops and accommodates himſelf to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane weakneſs; a faithful <hi>conatus,</hi> a ſincere, though imperfect Obedience, will ſerve the turn in order to Mans happineſs. This is the firſt ſtep which infinite Mercy takes in raiſing up Man out of the ruins of the Fall, The old terms were not ſtood upon.</p>
               <p>But now, that new terms might be made and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, that the ſecond Covenant might have an happier iſſue than the firſt, Mercy goes on to give the Son of God for us: <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</hi> John 3.16. This <hi>(ſo)</hi> is unutterable, this Love unmeaſurable, diffuſing it ſelf, not to Jews only, but to a World, and that overwhelmed in ſin; giving, and that freely, without any Merit of ours, a Son, and an only begotten Son, that we through faith in him might have life eternal, and there enjoy him who is Love it ſelf, for ever. Here is a Mine of Love too deep and rich for any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to fathom, or count the value of it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I open it, I ſhall firſt remove the ill uſe which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60626:46"/>the <hi>Socinians</hi> make of this Love, to overturn Chriſts Satisfaction. If God (ſay they) ſo loved us, as to give his Son for us, then he was not angry with us;<note place="margin">Oportuiſſe Deum jam pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiſſimum eſſe, <hi>Soc. de Serv. l. 1. c. 7.</hi> Non vos pudet, iram divinam, eam<expan>

                  </note> and if not angry, then there was no need at all of a Satisfaction to be made for us. Unto which I anſwer; Anger and Love are not inconſiſtencies, in Scripture both are attributed unto God: <hi>He gave his Son for us,</hi> was not that Love, immenſe Love? <hi>He wounded and bruiſed him for our iniquities: he made him to be ſin and a curſe for us;</hi> Was not there Wrath, great Wrath? We have both together in one Text, <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 John 4.10. The high Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis of his Love, was in giving his Son to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for us: unleſs there had been juſt anger, a Propitiation would have been needleſs; unleſs there had been immenſe Love, his Son ſhould not have been made one for us. We have a plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in <hi>Job's</hi> friends; Gods Wrath was kindled againſt them, and yet in love he directs them to atone him by a Sacrifice, <hi>Job</hi> 42.7, 8. God could not but be angry at the Sin of the World, and yet in love he gave his Son to be an expiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But for a more full anſwer, I ſhall lay down ſeveral things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. God may be conſidered either as a Rector, or as a Benefactor. As a Rector, he acts out of a juſt anger in vindicating his broken Law by Penal Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. As a Benefactor, he acts out of admirable love, in giving his Son to be a Propitiation for us. When he vindicates his Law by Puniſhments, Is it not Anger? when he gives his Son for us, Is it not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60626:46"/>Love? If he be a Rector, Can he not be a Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor too? Then he could not give his Son without laying down of his Government. If he be a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, Can he not be a Rector too? Then he could not govern, without laying down his Love; but if, as the truth is, he may be both, then Anger and Love may conſiſt together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Gods diſpleaſure may be taken either as it terminates on the ſin, or as it terminates on the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; as it terminates on the ſin, it is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removable. God himſelf, with reverence be it ſpoken, can no more remove it, than he can lay down his Sanctity, which in the very notion of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes an abhorrency of ſin: As it terminates on the ſinner, ſo it may be removed. This appears, in that God pardons ſin, and that (as the Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> imports) in ſuch a way, that the Penal Sufferings are tranſlated from the ſinner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Sponſor. The Divine diſpleaſure did paſs off from us, or elſe we could not have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned or ſaved; and it did light upon Chriſt, or elſe that Holy One could not have been made a Curſe, which no meer Sufferings, if abſtracted from Divine Wrath, can amount unto. We ſee here, there is diſpleaſure at the ſin, and yet infinite love towards the ſinner, in tranſlating the puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods Love is double, a Love of Complacence, which delights in the Creature, and a Love of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, which deſigns good to it. The firſt takes pleaſure in the Saints, who bear his holy Image. The ſecond diffuſes it ſelf to ſinners, who in themſelves are worthy of Wrath. Hence the Apoſtle tells us,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60626:47"/>
                  <hi>God commended his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us,</hi> Rom. 5.8. Sinners are objects of diſpleaſure, and yet Love breaks out towards them in that great inſtance, the Death of Chriſt. If ever there were anger in God, 'twas at the Sin of a World; if ever there were Love in him, 'twas in the Gift of his Son. Theſe two may very well ſtand together.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Man may be conſidered, either as a Sinner, or as a Creature. A man who hath a rebellious Son, may be angry with him as rebellious, and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate him as a Son. In like manner, God may be angry with us as Sinners, and yet love us as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Having removed the <hi>Socinian</hi>-Cavil, I ſhall now proceed to ſpeak of Gods Love, in giving his Son for us. Here I ſhall diſtinctly conſider the giver. The Gift. The manner how it was given. The perſons for whom. The evil removed, and good procured by it, and the excellent Evangelical terms built upon it. Each one of theſe will illuſtrate this Love in giving his Son for us.</p>
               <p>The Giver is God himſelf, no other could do it. And here two things offer themſelves to us:</p>
               <p>The one is the earlineſs of his Love. It was no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel temporary thing, but ancient, nay eternal; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Preſcience of the Fall he eternally deſigned, that his Son ſhould aſſume our Nature, and in it dye as an expiatory Sacrifice for us: Chriſt was the Lamb <hi>foreordained before the foundation of the world,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.20. He was ſet down for a Redeemer in the eternal Volumes before the world was up; and ſlain above in Decree, long before he was ſlain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60626:47"/>in Time. A Plaiſter was provided before the wound, a Saviour before the Fall of Man. When <hi>David</hi> would ſet forth Gods Mercy in the higheſt ſtrain, He doth it thus, <hi>His mercy is from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to everlaſting,</hi> Pſal. 103.17. Such is his Love in Chriſt, reaching, as I may ſay, from one end of eternity to another: Each one of us may cry out, as that Ancient did, <hi>Sero te amavi, Domine,</hi> Lord, 'twas late e're I loved thee. Our love is but of yeſterday, a temporary thing, but his was as early as eternity it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The other is the freeneſs of it. Love,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Ariſt, Rhet.</hi> l. 2. c. 4.</note> as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher ſpeaks, wills good to another for his ſake, not for our own. In that wonderful Gift of Chriſt, the Love was Gods, the profit ours. Mercy in man hath a kind of reſpect to the Donor: frail Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and the wheel of a mutable world tell him, That himſelf, the now giver, may peradventure come to be a receiver. Hence the Apoſtle would have us <hi>remember them in adverſity, as being in the body,</hi> Heb. 13.3, and reſtore the lapſed, <hi>conſidering thy ſelf,</hi> Gal. 6.1. It may be our own caſe. There is in ſuch acts of Mercy, a kind of reſpect to our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſelf, which poſſibly may become an object for Mercy. But Mercy in God, which is the ſuavity of his Eſſence, iſſues out in a pure gratuitous way; no ſuch reſpect can fall upon him, who is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and bleſſed for ever. In the freeneſs of his Love, there are two things conſiderable: On Gods part there was no want, on Mans no attractive.</p>
               <p>On Gods part there was no want of us, or our Services; were there want with him, he could not be God: Could we ſupply him, we ſhould be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60626:48"/>greater than himſelf in furniſhing him with that which he could not do for himſelf; He is All-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and what want can be in him? Infinite, and what can be added to him? An Ocean, though vaſt, yet, becauſe finite, may receive an addition from a little drop. But what can be added to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which in its unmeaſurable excellency com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes all things within it ſelf? <hi>All nations to him are but as the drop of the bucket, and as the ſmall duſt of the ballance,</hi> Iſa. 40.15. Their Righteouſneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not add one beam to his eſſential Glory, neither can their iniquity in the leaſt eclipſe it. However it be with the Creature, he is ſtill himſelf. His own happineſs a ſphere of all Perfections, a Theatre of Glory to himſelf. Hence it appears, that Gods Love in giving his Son for us, was not a Love of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but of fulneſs and redundance, flowing out in a pure gratuitous manner towards us, that the honour might be his, and the profit ours. He gives like himſelf, out of ſuper-effluent goodneſs, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes one who is a Donor only, but no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</p>
               <p>On Mans part there was no attractive, to move God to give his Son for us. Mans Love is uſually drawn out by ſome excellency or other in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: but what can draw out Gods? Could the Origine of all goodneſs be attracted by any thing in the Creature? Yet is it poſſible that any thing ſhould be found in a fallen Creature to attract it? Mans miſery was indeed the occaſion, but what was the attractive? Was our Love firſt, and a charm to his? Oh! no; to ſay, that a Creature is firſt in Love, is to blaſpheme the Supreme Goodneſs, which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60626:48"/>ſets up Love in it. The Apoſtle is expreſs, <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 John 4.10. Between men, Love is ordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal; he that loves, is beloved again: but here the Love was on one ſide only.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Ariſt. Rhet.</hi> l. 2. c. 4.</note> God loved his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Enemies ſo far, as to give his Son for them, to raiſe up their Love to its great Original. Among men an harmony of ſpirits, a ſameneſs of tempers is a motive to Love. But what? was there, could there be any ſuch thing in fallen man as ſuch? How then was he fallen? What need was there of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? That holy Harmony was Mans Primitive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude; and whileſt it laſted, there was no need of any reſtorer. Alas! fallen man was a very <hi>Chaos</hi> of corruption, his very rational Powers were depraved; there was fleſh in his ſpirit, enmity in his mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, who lighted up a pure Reaſon in him at the firſt. There was bondage in his Will, it could not; nay, ſuch was its horrible perverſneſs, it would not elevate it ſelf to the fountain of its liberty. Among men, goodneſs is an allective to Love: but what goodneſs was there in a fallen, degenerate Creature, full-fraught with ſin, and oppoſite to its Maker? The very reliques of the Divine Image, which ſin could not utterly expel out of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, were yet ſo captivated and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned there, that groſs Idolatry filled the world in ſpight of all the notions of a Deity implanted in the hearts of men. We ſee cleerly, there was no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive on our part: Why then did God give his Son for us? The only reaſon was from himſelf, it was meer Grace, ſelf-moving Mercy, a pure emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60626:49"/>of Love towards us unworthy Creatures, who might have been made the objects of his Wrath and that for ever.</p>
               <p>The next thing conſiderable is the Gift it ſelf, and that was the Son of God, very God; a greater, a dearer perſon could not be given; if we meaſure Gods Love by the Gift, it is like that, altogether unmeaſurable. Hence the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That there is a breadth, and length, and depth, and height, infinite dimenſions in it, ſuch as paſs the knowledg of men and angels,</hi> Eph. 3.18, 19. When God gave us the Creatures for our uſe, he gave us but the drops and models of his Goodneſs: but when he gave his Son for us, he gave himſelf; God was the Giver, and God the Gift. When God could ſwear by no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he ſware by himſelf; when he could give no greater, he gave himſelf. Here was Love acted to the uttermoſt, elevated to the higheſt point; a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Gift there could not be. 'Twas great Love in <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> that for him he would ſtrip himſelf of his Robe, nay, and venture the caſt of a Javelin from an angry Father. But what manner of Love was it in God, that he would ſtrip him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his Orient pearl; that he would give his Son, his eternal Joy out of his boſom, to aſſume an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and in it to bear the horrible ſtroke of Juſtice, which was due to us for our iniquities? In giving Laws and Promiſes, God gives but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Image of his Sanctity and Grace; but in giving his Son, he gave his eſſential increated Image to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the fleſh for us, that his holy Image, broken in the fall, might be repaired again in us. When we were off from God, the Center of Souls, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60626:49"/>wandring in the foul ways of ſin, God out of his immenſe Love, ſent no leſs perſon than his only begotten. Son to ſeek us, and bring us back unto himſelf, that we might be for ever happy in the fruition of him.</p>
               <p>The greatneſs of this Love will yet further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider the manner how the Son of God was given for us. The lower a man ſtoops and condeſcends to do another good, the higher and more eminent is his Love; the ſteps wherein the Son of God came down and humbled himſelf for us, evidently declare the infinite height of that Love, which made him ſtoop ſo low to compaſs our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The firſt ſtep was his Incarnation, the word was made fleſh; he, who was in the form of God, took on him an humane Nature. In the Creation infinite produced finite, but here infinite aſſumed finite; there Eternal brought forth Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but here Eternal took Temporal into it ſelf: and what a wonderful Condeſcenſion was this? It's true, Reaſon in the <hi>Socinian</hi> laughs at it, but Faith in the Chriſtian muſt needs admire it. Had the greateſt Monarch on Earth confined himſelf to the pooreſt Cottage there, it would have been nothing to God Tabernacling in the fleſh. Should the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Angel in Heaven have put off his Perfections, and come down into an humane Nature; and from thence have paſſed into a brutal beſtial one, and ſo on into a tree or ſtone, and at laſt into nullity; it would not have been a Condeſcenſion comparable to that of the Son of God coming in the fleſh. His Sacred Perſon was infinitely more above humane Nature, than an Angel is above matter or nullity it
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60626:50"/>ſelf: and what unparallel'd Love was here? The Creator became a Creature; the Son of God aſſumed our nature, and that after it was in us tainted with ſin.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> of the Attributes, <hi>fol.</hi> 171.</note> 
                  <q>The natural diſtance (ſaith that excellent Man) between God and the Creature is infinite; the Moral between God and the ſinful Creature, if poſſible, is more than infinite. Yet the mercy of our Redeemer overcame this diſtance. What an extaſie of Love tranſported the Son of God ſo far, as to eſpouſe our nature, after it was defiled and debaſed with ſin?

This made St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> overlook the wonders in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he might raviſh himſelf in the admirations of an Incarnate God. The Condeſcenſion was here ſo great, that God ſeems to neglect his own Majeſty, that he may comply with our neceſſities; yet infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Love would have the Son of God ſtoop a little lower, and do honour to that Sacred Law which we had violated. His humane Nature being an inmate in his infinite Perſon, could not but have a right to Heaven, and might have been immediately rapt up thither; but Love ſet him another task. He, the great Lawgiver, was made under the Law: He, who knew the Father in an infinity of light, now
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60626:50"/>knew him in a finite Reaſon: He who embraced the Father in an infinity of Love, now loved him in a finite Will: He, who was Lord of all, was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Parents and Magiſtrates: He, who upholds the world, went up and down as a man doing of good; he ſtooped as low as the Ceremonial Law: His pure fleſh was circumciſed, he kept the Paſſeover, and ſo obedientially ſtood under his own ſhadow. This is a Condeſcenſion much greater, than if all the Angels in Heaven had put themſelves under the Laws of the loweſt matter; yet infinite Love would have the Son of God go down a little lower. We have him hungry, thirſty, weary, weeping, ſuffering the contradiction of Sinners, enduring the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan, all his life-through a man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows: at laſt we have him bleeding on a Croſs, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there as a ſpectacle of ſhame; his hands and his feet were pierced, his body was racked and tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to death in a ſtinking <hi>Golgotha.</hi> But, which was the greateſt of all, he bore the Wrath of God: and what was that Wrath, which was due to the ſin of a World? or what thoſe Sufferings, which ſatisfied Juſtice for it? What a great thing was the Paſſion of God? and how much beyond the diſſolution of a World? Words cannot utter it, thoughts cannot meaſure it. That Love muſt be no leſs than immenſe, which made the Son of God ſtoop ſo low, to take us up out of the ruins of the Fall.</p>
               <p>The Love of God will yet more appear, if we take notice of the perſons for whom Chriſt was given; it was for man, poor impotent man, a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture worth nothing, a bankrupt in Spirituals, one void of all thoſe Primitive Excellencies, which at
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60626:51"/>firſt Crowned the humane Nature; for him it was, that God was at ſo vaſt an expence, as that of his own blood.<note place="margin">Spond. Annal. <hi>Anno 431.</hi>
                  </note> 'Twas great Charity in <hi>Paulinus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nola,</hi> that he would give himſelf in pawn to the <hi>Vandals</hi> for a poor Child; but it was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent ſuperlative Love in God, to give his Son, one worth Millions of Worlds, and as rich in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies as a Deity could make him, to be emptied and humbled to death for poor worthleſs worms, ſuch as we are. <hi>Ye know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that though he was rich, yet for our ſakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. The Riches of a God were laid out to ſet up broken man again. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it was for Sinners, for Enemies, ſuch as were in Arms againſt God; ſuch as had broken his Laws, deſpiſed his Authority, caſt off his Soveraignty, and as much as in them lay, ſtained his Glory. Theſe were the perſons, upon whoſe Salvation infinite Love ſet ſo high a rate, that rather than fail, the Life of God ſhould be paid down for it. The Apoſtle notably ſets forth this, <hi>Scarcely for a righteous man will one dye, yet peradventure for a good man ſome would even dare to dye: But God commended his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us,</hi> Rom. 5.7, 8. Sometimes poſſibly, though but rarely, one may dye for a righteous good Man, who is a bleſſing to the place where he lives. But this was Chriſts Prerogative to dye for Sinners: this was the ſupereminency of Divine Love to give him ſo to do. <hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,</hi> Joh. 15.13. Thus our Saviour. A greater proof or
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60626:51"/>effect of Love than death there cannot be; but Love is then in an higher and more excellent degree, when that death is, as in our Saviours caſe it was, for Enemies, than it is, when the death is for Friends. <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias,</hi> two intimate friends, were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to dye one for another; but Chriſt died for Enemies. In Creation God overcame Nullity, but in Redemption he overcomes Enmity it ſelf, and that in a wonderful way: He aſſumes an humane Nature, and in it pours out his precious blood, to melt and break that horrible Enmity, which was in us againſt him.</p>
               <p>If we would ſee more of this Love, let us turn our eyes upon the evils removed, and the good procured by our Saviour Chriſt.</p>
               <p>All evils are either Moral, ſuch as ſin; or which waits upon the other, Phyſical, ſuch as puniſhment: all of them are removed by our Saviour, who ſaves from Sin and Wrath. Man was under the guilt of Sin, and ſo under the Wrath of God. Wrath in the threatning hung as an horrible Tempeſt over his head, and within there was the dreadful Eccho of it in Conſcience. But the Sufferings of Chriſt were ſo ſatisfactory and meritorious for us, that as ſoon as we return and believe on him, all our guilt is done away. It's true, the guilt in it ſelf, in the intrinſecal deſert of puniſhment, is perpetual, becauſe ſin cannot ceaſe to be ſin; but it doth no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound upon our perſons, to oblige us to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The heavy burden is now lifted off from Conſcience, the black Cloud of Wrath is diſſolved, the curſing Law hath nothing to ſay againſt us; <hi>There is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:60626:52"/>Rom. 8.1. It's true, afflictions may fall upon a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, but there is no Condemnation, there is not a jot of Wrath in them; they are rather Caſtigatory than Penal, managed in the hand of Mercy, rather than Juſtice. In the iſſue it appears, that there was Love and Faithfulneſs in them, that even in thoſe afflicting paths, Mercy and Truth are found: all things ſhall work together for good unto the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, Afflictions and all. Theſe ſerve for excellent purpoſes, to fan off his Vanity, melt away his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, alarm his ſpiritual Watch, refine his golden Graces, caſt him into the Image of a meek ſuffering Chriſt, unearth, unſelf him, and elevate his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards the everlaſting reſt which is above. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, after it hath budded and bloſſomed with ſuch precious fruits, is no longer evil, but an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good. It's true alſo, that death Temporal will ſeize upon him, but the curſe is gone, the ſting out; death, which at firſt was a puniſhment, now hath a bleſſing in it. It was Originally introduced by ſin; but through the admirable Grace of our Saviour it carries away thoſe reliques of ſin, which no Tears, Prayers, Watchings, Pious endeavours could utterly extirpate, whileſt we are in the body: it throws down the earthen walls into their mother-duſt. But who would not dye, and with <hi>Hilarion</hi> bid his Soul, Go out, that he might be rid of ſin? There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a paſſage out of a Temporal life, but it is into an Eternal one. The ſoul, when it leaves its old friend the body, flies into the bleſſed Region, there to enjoy God in an immediate manner; to read truth in its Original, and taſte goodneſs in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: the body, which at preſent diſſolves into duſt,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60626:52"/>ſhall wake again, and be made like to the glorious body of Chriſt. Mortal ſhall put on immortality, corruptible incorruption, death ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory; it is no longer an evil to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</p>
               <p>Again, Man was under the Power of Sin, and ſo under the Tyranny of Satan. Sin was a Lord, a Ruler over him; not only over his outward man, whoſe members were the weapons of it, but over the inward too. It had ſtrong-holds in his Reaſon, and a throne in his Will; he was a drudg, a ſlave to his luſts, hurried up and down by one Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other; wandring in error, or ſwelling in pride, or pining in envy, or boiling in malice, or burning in luſt, or drowning in ſenſual pleaſures, ſome way or other ſerving his Iniquity. Satan, the Ruler of darkneſs, hath a Palace in his heart, and keeps poſſeſſion there; upon all occaſions he blows up Original Corruption into ſinful motions, motions into conſents, conſents into acts, acts into habits. Thus he carries on the ſinner in a circle of ſinning, till inevitable ruin overtake him; but in and through Chriſt there is deliverance from this horrible ſervitude. The Holy Spirit comes and reſcues the ſinner; it opens his eyes to ſee himſelf ſtanding, as he doth, at the brink of Hell and Death; it melts him into tears and godly ſorrows for ſin; it breaks down the ſtrong-holds and throne of ſin in the heart; it caſts out Satan and the helliſh furniture; it tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the poor ſinner from the power of darkneſs, into the Kingdom of Chriſt, into a Region of Grace and Power, where Sin and Satan cannot have the Victory. Thoſe precious Promiſes, that ſin ſhall
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60626:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>not have Dominion, that Satan ſhall be bruiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our feet, are now ſealed and experimented in the heart. The poor Captive is now brought out of Bondage, into the true liberty of Holineſs and Obedience. Here we ſee the matchleſs incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Love of God, which delivered us from ſo many great Evils. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> being reſcued from Death, made his acknowledgments: <hi>O Lord, thou haſt in love to my ſoul delivered me from the pit of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> or, as the Original hath it, <hi>Thou haſt loved my ſoul from the pit of corruption.</hi> Every Believer, who hath taſted of the great Salvation, may ſay, <hi>Lord, thou haſt loved me from Sin, Satan, Death, Hell, by delivering me from all theſe evils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, as all evils were removed, ſo all good things were procured by Chriſt. Temporals were ſo, the world owes its ſtanding to him. Juſtice, but for his expiatory Sacrifice, would have daſhed it down about the ſinners <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ears. Sin, but for the Cement of his blood, would have unframed all things in nature: that right to the Creature, which we forfeited by our iniquity, was reſtored again by his Merits. The Believer ſhall now have ſo much of the world, as infinite Wiſdom and Mercy (more competent Judges than humane Reaſon and Will), ſhall think a fit portion for him; and what he hath, he ſhall have with the Love of God, which, as it is the higheſt ſuavity in it ſelf, ſo it pours out a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious reliſh into all outward things. Spirituals were ſo; thoſe initial Graces of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which introduce us into an Union with Chriſt, are from him. <hi>He is a Prince and Saviour to give repentance,</hi> Acts 5.31. <hi>To you it is given in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60626:53"/>the behalf of Chriſt to believe on him,</hi> Phil. 1.29. As ſoon as we repent and believe, we are juſtified in his blood, and by a conjunction with him the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Son, we have power and right to become the Sons of God by Adoption and Grace. The Holy Spirit, the fountain of Graces and Comforts, which was upon him the head above meaſure, will fall down upon us his Members in a proportion; every Grace, every piece of the glorious new-creature is created in him. In the power of his Merits and Spirit, every comfort, every beam of Divine Favour comes down to us through him. He is the true Mercy-ſeat, where God meets and communes in words of Grace with us. Eternals were ſo too; all the weights of Glory, and Crowns of life in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, were purchaſed by him. His blood opens the Holy of Holies, the pure River of life ſprings out of his Merits, <hi>the gift of God is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 6.28. Had it not been for him, we could never have entred into ſuch a bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as Heaven. What a Gift is Chriſt, which vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually contains all gifts and good things in him! How incomparable that Love, which gave us ſo compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive a Gift!</p>
               <p>In the laſt place let us conſider the excellent Evangelical Terms, which were founded on the Death of Chriſt. Here two things are conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The one is this, The terms are eaſier. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works was, <hi>Do this and live:</hi> The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is, <hi>Believe, repent, and live.</hi> The firſt called for pure, ſinleſs, perfect obedience: The laſt ſtoops and condeſcends to fallen man; it accepts of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60626:54"/>ſincere, though imperfect obedience; uprightneſs paſſes for perfection, the main of the heart for all of it: the will is accepted for the work, pure aims are taken for compleat performances, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities are covered with indulgence, duties are taken into the hand of a Mediator, and perfumed with his infinite Merits; and hence they are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and as ſweet Odours to God. O how low doth infinite Love and Mercy ſtoop to poor ſinners! It will ſave a repenting believing ſinner, and how can it poſſibly go lower? That God ſhould juſtifie an impenitent unbelieving ſinner, is utterly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Holineſs, unleſs he would open a gap to all ſin and wickedneſs, and make it capable to have a Crown of happineſs at laſt. He could not more condeſcend, than he hath done in the terms of the Goſpel: there is a Kingdom for the poor in ſpirit, a Comfort for the mourners, an acceptance for a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind, a favourable reſpect for the leaſt ſpark of grace, which is latent in a deſire, and but as a little ſmoke, or wiek in the ſocket (as the expreſſion is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.20.) And what condeſcending Love is here? How could God ſtoop lower for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men?</p>
               <p>The other is this, The terms are ſurer. It's true, <hi>Adam,</hi> had he ſtood in Righteouſneſs, would have had a reward. But the difference is this, Under the firſt Covenant it was not certain, that <hi>Adam,</hi> though he had ſufficient grace, ſhould ſtand; but under the ſecond it is as ſure, as Gods Truth and Faithfulneſs in the promiſe can make it, that a people ſhall be gathered up out of the corrupt Maſs of mankind; that Chriſt ſhall have a repenting believing ſeed,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60626:54"/>and that they ſhall abide and perſevere till they come to the recompence of reward in Heaven. St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> diſtinguiſhes of a double <hi>adjutorium gratiae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Corrept. &amp; Grat. <hi>cap. 12.</hi>
                  </note> or help of grace. <hi>Adam</hi> had that grace, without which he could not have obeyed; Gods People have that, which cauſes them to obey. The firſt gave him a <hi>poſſe,</hi> a power to obey and perſevere: The ſecond gives us the very <hi>velle &amp; perficere,</hi> the very willing and working with perſeverance. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he obſerves, that <hi>Adams</hi> will, though ſound and without ſpot, did not perſevere in an ampler good, whileſt our will, though weak and infected with indwelling Corruption, doth perſevere in a leſſer. <hi>Adam,</hi> with all his Holineſs fell before an Apple, a little titillation of pleaſure; but the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Martyrs have ſtood it out, notwithſtanding the reliques of ſin in them, againſt racks and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Under the firſt Covenant the ſtock of Grace was in Mans own hand, the ſtreſs lay upon his Will; the principle of Holineſs in him was ſubjected to it, to be continued or forfeited. But under the ſecond Covenant, which was founded at ſo vaſt an expence as the Blood of God, Mans Will is not made Truſtee a ſecond time, the ſtock is not in his own hand; Grace is a Victor, and ſubdues the Will unto it ſelf. Hence this Covenant cannot, as the other did, miſcarry: God was a friend to innocent <hi>Adam;</hi> but in the ſecond Covenant God comes nearer to us in a double Union, ſuch as <hi>Adam</hi> never dreamt of. There is an Hypoſtatical Union, the Son of God taking our nature into himſelf, and, which is founded thereon, a Myſtical Union, Believers being in a wonderful manner united unto Chriſt, as members
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60626:55"/>unto their head. In the firſt Union of the Divine and Humane Nature in Chriſt, there is one Perſon. In the ſecond, Chriſt and Believers make one Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. Believers are but Chriſt diſplayed: he lives in them, he counts himſelf incomplete with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. By virtue of theſe two Unions it is, that Believers finally perſevere; <hi>Becauſe I live</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ye ſhall live alſo,</hi> John 14.19. Their life is bound up in his; as long as Chriſt the head is alive above, the believing Members below ſhall not fail of quickning grace, to maintain ſpiritual life unto eternal. The Holy Spirit is in them a <hi>well of water, ſpringing up to everlaſting life,</hi> John 4.14; and to ſecure the abode of the Spirit with them, Chriſt is a Prieſt <hi>after the power of an endleſs life,</hi> Heb. 7.16. In the Covenant of Works, there was no promiſe of perſeverance; but in the Covenant of Grace there are many ſuch promiſes: <hi>God ſhall confirm you unto the end,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.8. <hi>He will put his fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from him,</hi> Jer. 32.40. The Apoſtle praying for the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that they may be <hi>preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of Chriſt,</hi> immediately adds, <hi>Faithful is he that called you, who alſo will do it,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.23, 24; evidently God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes it, and engages his Faithfulneſs in it. To take theſe Promiſes conditionally, is utterly to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate them; to make them run thus, If we will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, we ſhall perſevere; and ſo much was true under the old Covenant, and without any Promiſe at all. The clear ſcope of thoſe Promiſes is, That Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are not left in their own hand, but kept in Gods; and how ſure an hand that is, our Saviour tells us, <hi>None can pluck them out of my Fathers
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60626:55"/>hand,</hi> John 10.29. I know ſome take theſe words with a limitation, None can pluck them away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own voluntary conſent: but this limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes the words altogether inſignificant; it is not poſſible, that they ſhould be plucked away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their conſent: The words therefore, with that limitation, run thus, None can pluck them, but in ſuch a way as the ſame is poſſible to be done; and thus they ſignifie nothing. That which our Saviour makes impoſſible in the Text, becomes in the Gloſs as poſſible as any other thing. Here we ſee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Love of God to his People; there is in Chriſt an everlaſting Covenant ordered in all things, and ſure; they are preſerved in Chriſt, and that unto ſalvation.</p>
               <p>This infinite immenſe Love of God in Chriſt can do no leſs than call for a return. What? was it not enough for him to give us a World of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Hath he given his Son, his only begotten, dearly beloved Son for us? Hath he given him ſo far, as to be made fleſh, and made under the Law, the command and curſe of it? Hath he thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all Evils, and procured all good things for us? Hath he done this for Sinners, for Enemies, and that out of an eternal deſign of Grace; out of ſuch Love, as was an impulſe to it ſelf, without any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive on our part to move him thereunto? And after all this, ſhall not our hearts take fire, and burn within us with Love to him again? When his Love was up in Eternity, ſhall not ours appear in time? When he loved us worthleſs, meritleſs Creatures, ſhall not we love him upon the higheſt and greateſt attractives? When he gave his Son, when the Giver
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60626:56"/>and the Gift were both infinite, ſhall our finite af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be ſhut up from him, or denied unto him? Our Love to his is but a little drop, a poor incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable nothing: and with what face or reaſon can we withhold it, when infinite Love calls for it? Hath God himſelf come down, as it were, from his altitude, and in admirable Grace followed us? Firſt into our fleſh, and then into a Law-ſubjection, and at laſt into a Curſe and Penal Sufferings; and all this upon an errand of Peace and Reconciliation to reduce us again to himſelf, and to happineſs in him: and ſhall we yet fly away from him, and by an horrible indignity turn our backs upon ſuch admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble purſuits of Love and Grace? After ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from Sin and Hell as this, May we think our ſelves our own, or turn away our hearts, ſo much as in the glance of a thought, from ſo great a Saviour? After ſuch a purchaſe of Grace and Heaven, ſhould we not lye down at his feet in exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical admirations, and ſend up our deareſt affections to the great Donor? If Creatures, if Laws, if Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances move us not; ſhall we yet be unaffected at the ſpectacle of a God incarnate, obeying, bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, dying, for us Sinners and Enemies? It's horrible ingratitude, having ſuch a proſpect of infinite Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes. Let us do, as becomes us; give God our heart, not a piece or corner of it, but all; not in ſome weak languid velleities, but in the higheſt ſtrains and raiſures of ſpirit; not in ſome drops or rivulets, but in a full ſtream and current of affections, ſuch as is due to him who is the Original of ſouls. Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, before vagrant on Earth, ſhould now take Wing and fly up to Heaven; our Love, once in corrupt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60626:56"/>conjunction with Creatures, ſhould now aſpire after a pure Union with him, who is Love it ſelf: Our delights ſhould no longer toy or ſport with vanity, but ſpread, and ſweetly dilate themſelves in the Beams of infinite Goodneſs: All the Powers of our Souls ſhould now be gathered in from the World, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on a full deliberate choice ſhould be placed upon the Center of Perfections. The proof of all this muſt be in a life of Obedience; without this it is meer vanity to ſay, that we love him. Holy Love goes not alone, or without a train of good works following after it: the warmth and ardor of it in the heart purifies the life; the inward ſuavity of it facilitates the outward Command, and naturalizes us to Obedience: as it ſets a high rate and eſtimation upon God himſelf, ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every jot and tittle of his Law. The complacency, which we find in him, makes us take pleaſure in all the pure ways, which he hath ſet before us; if we eſteem him above Worlds and Creatures, we will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Will to be above all Wills, and ſubject ours to it.</p>
               <p>Moreover the Love of God moves us to love our Neighbour. What? hath God gone before us in ſuch admirable ſteps of Love? and ſhall we not <hi>be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of him as dear children, and walk in love,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1, 2? Can there be an higher or nobler pattern than Love it ſelf? Shall he do good in the ſphere of Nature, and more and higher good in the ſphere of Grace, and we do none in our little ſphere? Shall infinite Bowels and Mercies be open, and finite ones ſhut? When God hath given ſo great a Gift as his own Son, May we withhold our little Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of Charity? Would we receive all, and give
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60626:57"/>nothing? Exact pence from our Brother, when Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents are forgiven to our ſelves? Is God come into our fleſh? and ſhall we hide our ſelves from it, I mean, in the neglect or contempt of the poor? Did he take humanity, that we ſhould put it off? No, in ſo doing we ſhould reproach not our Maker only, but our Redeemer too. Inhumanity is now double, treble, to what it was before our Saviour took an humane Nature, to read us a Lecture of Love and Goodneſs in: the old Commandment of Love is now a new one, urged upon us by a new Motive, The incomparable Love of God in his giving his Son for us. If we now ſhut up our Bowels and Mercies from others, how dwelleth the Love of God in us? What ſenſe can we have of it upon our hearts? Charity was the badg of the Primitive Chriſtians. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of Gods Love upon Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> was ſo great, that he never denied any that asked for Jeſus ſake. Our Love towards men ſhould be a little picture or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of Gods Love towards us. Our Mercies and Compaſſions ſhould tell the world, that we have taſted of that infinite Grace and Mercy which is above. Our Charity towards all ſhould bear witneſs, that we have been great receivers from God. Our Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Enemies ſhould be a thankful acknowledgment, that we being ſuch, were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IN the next place I come to conſider the Power of God. Power being a Perfection, muſt needs be in him, and being (as all other Attributes are) his very Eſſence, it muſt needs be infinite. The very light of Nature reveals this Attribute. In the <hi>Grecian</hi> Philoſophers he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Omnipotent; <hi>Nihil eſt, quod Deus efficere non poſſet,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tully. Ludovicus Vives</hi> wonders,<note place="margin">Comment. in Aug. de Civit. <hi>l. 5. c. 10.</hi>
                  </note> that ſo learned a Man as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſhould cavil at Gods Omnipotence, as if he could not do all things, becauſe he could not dye. In Scripture he is called <hi>Gibbor,</hi> a mighty one; <hi>Shaddai,</hi> an All-ſufficient God: he is <hi>the only Potentate,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.15. He can do every thing, <hi>Job</hi> 42.2. Nothing is too hard for him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.14. Power belongeth to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.11. Whatever is an act of Power,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60626:58"/>that he can do; that he cannot do contradictories, is not Impotency, but Power and Perfection: for him to lye, were to deny his own Truth; for him to dye, were to caſt off his Immortality; for him to make a thing be, and at the ſame inſtant to make it not to be, were to act repugnantly, and overturn his own action. Theſe argue Impotency, not Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. We may more properly ſay, that theſe cannot be done, than that God cannot do them: he can do all things, which being done, do argue Power or Perfection; but what argues Impotency, can no more fall upon him, than darkneſs can ſeize upon the Sun.</p>
               <p>This excellent Attribute of Power was eminently ſet forth in Chriſt: He is called <hi>the power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24. Divine Power ſhews forth it ſelf in him in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt it breaks out in his Incarnation. <hi>The word was made fleſh,</hi> John 1.14. <hi>He, who was in the form of God, took upon him the form of a ſervant,</hi> Phil. 2.6, 7; that is, he, who had the Eſſence and Majeſty of God, aſſumed ſo low a thing as an humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: He did not lay down his Deity, but aſſumed an Humanity; two Natures, a Divine and Humane, were in one perſon. Never did God come ſo near the Creature as here. He was in the world by his Univerſal Preſence; he was in the Temple in types and ſymbols; in the Saints he is by his Grace, in Heaven he is in immediate Glory: but in the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation he is hypoſtatically in an humane Nature. The perſon of the Word, which was from Eternity an Hypoſtaſis to his Divine Nature, became an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſis to his humane Nature in time. O what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60626:58"/>of Power are here! Here God was made Man, the Creator became one with his Creature! Had the whole world been crowded into a ſingle Atom, it would have been infinitely a leſs wonder than this; the putting a greater finite into a leſs, cannot be comparable to the taking of finite into infinite. Here are two Natures, a Divine and an Humane, in themſelves infinitely diſtant, met in perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; finite is not abſorp't by infinite, infinite is not changed by finite. Here Eternal dwells in the ſame perſon with Temporal, yet runs not into ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; immortal dwells with mortal, yet falls not into paſſion. Here an humane Nature is united to a perſon infinitely ſimple, and infinitely compleat; yet he loſes not his ſimplicity, nor yet doth he receive any additional perfection. Here's an humane Nature without any Perſonality of its own. Naturally the humane Nature of Chriſt would have had a Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of its own; a Perſonality would have flown from it: but the reſultance was miraculouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; the want of its own finite Subſiſtence was ſupplied by the Preſence of an infinite one;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> of the words In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carn. <hi>fol.</hi> 81.</note> the Son of God communicated his Hypoſtaſis to it, to ſuſtain it. Here we have in ſome reſpect more of Divine Power manifeſted, than there was in the making of the World. When meer nothing was by an Almighty word elevated into Elements, Plants, Beaſts, Men, Angels, ſtill it was but into finite; but here a finite humane Nature was taken into infinite: and between the infinite God and the humane Nature, the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity muſt be far greater than it is between a world and nothing. Here indeed God did not create an infinite (that being impoſſible), but he came as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60626:59"/>near it as poſſibly could be, by aſſuming a finite Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into himſelf. All other Creatures are compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively <hi>extra Deum;</hi> but here the humane Nature was in the very inſtant of its production, interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the infinite Perſon of the Son. Thus we ſee, that in this ſtupendious work, Divine Power acted magnificently and congruouſly to its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity; never any work did ſo fully anſwer and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to Omnipotence as this.</p>
               <p>A ſecond inſtance of Power we have in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of our Saviour: his body was not formed in an ordinary way, by the concurrence of Man and Woman, but in a way ſuper-natural; A Virgin was with Child. As the body of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was wonderfully framed out of the duſt; ſo the body of the ſecond was admirably framed out of the Virgin. That a Virgin ſhould be with Child, was a great, an high Miracle, far above all the Power of Nature. How then was it effected? The Evangeliſt tells us, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt came upon her, the power of the higheſt did overſhadow her,</hi> Luk. 1.35. This is a ſublime tremendous Myſtery; the Holy Ghoſt, as the word <hi>(overſhadow)</hi> imports, did, as it were, caſt a Cloud over her; to teach us, that we ſhould not over-cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly pry into ſo great a Work as this was. The body of our Saviour was not produced ſpermatically, out of the ſubſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, but Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, by the Power of it. The matter of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was from the ſubſtance of the Virgin; the active Principle was the infinite Spirit. The ſeed of Man was not here uſed; it was not congruous, that he, who had God for his Father, ſhould have any Man to be ſo: it was a miraculous extraordinary opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60626:59"/>Hence Chriſt is called, <hi>The ſtone cut out of the mountains without hands,</hi> Dan. 2.34. There was an Almighty Power in the framing his humane Nature; the Tabernacle of his body was not pitched by Man, but by the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.2. There was a ſupernatural operation in the making of it; it is called <hi>a tabernacle not made with hands, that is to ſay, not of this building, Heb.</hi> 9.11. It was not made in a natural ordinary way of generation. It's true, he took part of our fleſh and blood; but the manner of framing his body was in an extraordinary way, the ſtructure of it was Divine, and much above that of our bodies.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance of the Divine Power we have in the Miracles wrought by Jeſus Chriſt. The <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins</hi> diſtinguiſh of a twofold Work of God; they call his ordinary Works of Nature, <hi>opus Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhith,</hi> from the firſt words of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous works, <hi>opus Merchebha,</hi> from <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot. A miracle is a work lifted up above the Order and Power of Nature: it is a ſpecimen of Creation, ſomething is made out of nothing. What ſecond cauſes cannot reach, that is done by the firſt; no Man, no Angel can do ſuch a work. Theſe are but parts of Nature, and therefore cannot in their Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations exceed Nature; <hi>Quod eſt totaliter ſub ordine conſtitutum, non poteſt ultra iſtius naturae ordinem agere;</hi> it is only Gods Prerogative to work Miracles. He that ſet the order of Nature, can work above it; he can lift Nature off the hinges, and ſet it on again; and when he doth it, he doth it as becomes his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom, upon very great and weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. When he brought his People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:60626:60"/>then his wonders appeared; when he delivered his Law on <hi>Sinai,</hi> his wonders appeared again. In thoſe great diſpenſations he ſhewed himſelf, not in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary dreſs of Nature, but in Royal State and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; much more did he do ſo, when his Son, very God, was manifeſted in the fleſh. Then the water was turned into Wine, the Wind and the Seas did obeyſance to their incarnate Creator: the blind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their ſight, the lame did walk, the Lepers were cleanſed, the deaf did hear, the dead were raiſed, the devils were caſt out of Men. Here the right hand of the Lord was glorious in Power. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did, as it were, leap and triumph in miraculous elevations above it ſelf, at the coming down of its Creator, to redeem the world: a mighty train of wonders attended on that greateſt wonder of all, God incarnate; a life of Miracles enſued upon his miraculous Conception. Now touching the Miracles of Chriſt, there are three or four things to be taken notice of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Miracles of Chriſt were true, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a double account.</p>
               <p>The one is this, They were true in the Hiſtory of them, they were really done: we have them upon Record in the Sacred Volume of Scripture; they were not done in a corner, or before a few, but openly, and before multitudes; there were thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of eye-witneſſes, from whom the truth of them hath been handed down in all ages of the Church. There is no colour at all to imagine, that thoſe firſt reporters did utter an untruth, or go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to put a cheat upon the world: their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity would not ſuffer it, neither was the thing it
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60626:60"/>ſelf indeed practicable. How ſhould ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, for the moſt part unknown to, and diſtant from each other, ever agree and conſpire together in the very ſame ſtory? Or, if they could, what ſhould they propoſe to themſelves? or which way could they think, that a Relation of things to have been done openly, if falſe, ſhould ever paſs in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting World? They knew very well, that there were innumerable prying malicious Enemies round about them, who would perſecute them for that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, though true, and brand them as lyars for it, if falſe. Chriſtianity was then a poor perſecuted thing, and it would have been ſtrange folly and madneſs in them, to have ventured their lives and eſtates meerly to broach a lye unto the world; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing it muſt have been ſuch an one, as would have been ſurely diſcovered to be ſuch, and ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed upon the Authors. In all reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what the firſt Witneſſes ſpake was true; and what after-ages heard, was but the Eccho of their report. The Miracles wrought by our Saviour were ſo great, that none of the Adverſaries ever durſt deny, that they were done. The <hi>Jews</hi> did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it:<note place="margin">P. Gal. de Arc. <hi>l. 8. c. 5.</hi>
                  </note> their ancient <hi>Rabbins</hi> take thoſe words of the Prophet, <hi>Then the eyes of the blind ſhall be opened, and the ears of the deaf ſhall be unſtopped: the lame ſhall leap as the hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſhall ſing,</hi> Iſa. 35.5, 6. to be ſpoken of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Their own <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſpeaks of Jeſus as one more than a man, and a worker of great Miracles; only the <hi>Jews,</hi> out of their deſperate malice againſt our Saviour, defamed his Miracles as done by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick: and, as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Harm.</hi> fol. 30.</note> it is ſaid in <hi>Talm.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60626:61"/>Bab.</hi> that <hi>Ben Sarda</hi> (which is a blaſphemous name they give to Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi>) did bring inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in inciſion in his fleſh. But there cannot be a vainer thought than to imagine, that Satan ſhould contribute wonders to confirm that Doctrine, which he knew would utterly ruin his Kingdom. When the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſaid, that Chriſt did caſt out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub.</hi> He anſwered two things: Firſt, that Satans Kingdom, if divided, could not ſtand, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.26. And then, that they, in ſaying ſo, did maliciouſly oppoſe their light, and run into the unpardonable ſin, <hi>verſ.</hi> 31, 32. But when the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaw that this pretence would not ſerve their turn, they betook themſelves to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſhift, and ſaid, That the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> when he came, ſhould do no Miracles at all. The <hi>Pagans</hi> did not deny Chriſts Miracles. In <hi>Pilates</hi> Letter to the Emperor <hi>Tiberius,</hi> there is an enumeration made of his Miracles. In the Epiſtle of <hi>Lentulus</hi> to <hi>Tiberius</hi> he is ſtiled,<note place="margin">Magd. Hiſt. Cent. <hi>1. l. 1. c. 10.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Homo magnae virtutis.</hi> The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> conſcious to themſelves that the thing was not to be denied,<note place="margin">Aug. de Conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu Evang. <hi>l. 1. c. 9.</hi>
                  </note> cryed up <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> and <hi>Apollonins,</hi> in oppoſition to Chriſt; and withal framed an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent lye, that our Saviour had Magical Books, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which he did his Miracles. Such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices as theſe, were, I ſuppoſe, firſt ſtarted by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the Apoſtate, and by him inſtilled into others. The <hi>Mahometans,</hi> fairer than the other, confeſs Chriſts Miracles to have been done, and that from God.<note place="margin">Morn. de Ver. Chriſt. Relig. <hi>c. 33.</hi>
                  </note> Their <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſaith, That Gods Spirit was a help and witneſs to Jeſus, that the Soul of God was given to him. Thus it appears on all hands, that the matter of Fact touching our Saviours Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, cannot be denied.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:60626:61"/>
               <p>The other is this, They were true for the nature of Miracles: they were not, as the Devils wonders are, meer Spectrum's or Apparitions, but real Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, things which are above the order of Nature, and lye within the line of Omnipotence only; the matter, mode, and end ſignally declare them to be ſuch. Some Miracles of Chriſt, ſuch as raiſing the dead, were ſuch for the matter of them, that no <hi>conatus</hi> of nature, no concurrence or conjunction of created Powers could ever have effected them, no, not in Millions of Ages; ſome of them, ſuch as Curing the ſick, Nature might have done, but in a tract of time, and with the help of ſecond Cauſes. But our Saviour diſpatched them out of hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, immediately, with a word or a touch: To operate after this ſort, is only proper to God, who is excellent in working. When Satan, who labours to emulate Divine Works, doth wonders, the end of them declares their Original; ſuitably to the Author they ſerve only to lead men into lies and Idolatries. Antichriſt comes with <hi>lying wonders,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.9. Lying wonders in themſelves, as being phantaſms and mockeries of ſenſe; and lying wonders, as tending to confirm men in falſe Doctrine and Worſhip: but the Miracles of Chriſt, being real ones, were done to ratifie the ſuper-natural Truths and pure Worſhip of God. The <hi>Jews</hi> have a rule, that we ſhould believe him who doth Miracles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be the Author of Idolatrous Worſhip: had they adhered to this rule, they could not but have embraced our Saviour, who with ſo many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ſealed up the true Doctrine and Worſhip of God.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:60626:62"/>
               <p n="2">2. The Miracles of Chriſt were not a few, but very numerous; not in one or two places, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed over the Creation, thereby to proclaim that the Creator was come down to redeem the World. There were Miracles upon the Water, he turned it into Wine, <hi>John</hi> 2.9. Shewing himſelf to be the Lord of Nature; here doing that in an inſtant, which he doth every year in the Vine: Miracles in the Sea, a fiſh brings him the tribute-money, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.27. to declare, that all Creatures were Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries to him. After an whole nights toil to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Net being let down at his word, <hi>encloſed a great multitude of fiſhes,</hi> Luk. 5.5, 6. So that the awe of his Divine Power fell upon all the Spectators. Miracles upon the Sea and Air together; in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt he <hi>rebuked the winds and the Sea, and there was a great calm,</hi> Matth. 8.26, as a proof that all the Elements were his ſervants. Miracles upon the loaves, in multiplying of them, <hi>John</hi> 6.11, and upon the <hi>fig-tree, in making it to wither away,</hi> Matth. 21.19; as a clear demonſtration, that his bleſſing and curſe were great things. Miracles upon the bodies of men, in <hi>healing all manner of ſickneſs and diſeaſe,</hi> Matth. 4.23; and upon their ſouls too, in making them <hi>every whit whole,</hi> John 7.23; in token that he was the great Phyſician of both. Miracles in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: at his Birth a ſtar conducted the Wiſe-men to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.2; at his paſſion the Sun was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.45. The ſtar waited upon its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor at his Birth, the Sun ſympathized with him in his Paſſion. Miracles upon the Devils, in caſting them out by his Word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.16. A ſure ſign, that the Powers of Hell could not ſtand it out againſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60626:62"/>him. Very various are the Miracles of our Saviour recorded in Scripture: But <hi>if all had been written, the world could not have contained the books,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 21. verſ. 25. The words are Hyperbolical, yet they import, that many of his Works were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Writing. <hi>Arnobius</hi> enumerates the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Works of Chriſt, and then cries out,<note place="margin">Adv. Gent. <hi>l. 1</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Quid ſimile Dii omnes, a quibus opem dicitis aegris &amp; peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitantibus latam?</hi> When did the <hi>Pagan</hi> Cods do the like, from whom you ſay, that help is afforded to men in ſickneſs or danger? Never was there ſuch plenty of Miracles as here.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Miracles of Chriſt were very great: <hi>He did thoſe works which no other man did,</hi> Joh. 15.24. It was never ſo ſeen in <hi>Iſrael, Matth.</hi> 9.33. I ſhall inſtance in two or three things: Firſt, he raiſed up the dead: The maid in her Fathers houſe, the young man carried out upon the byer, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> four days dead and ſtinking in the Grave. What things are theſe? How much above all the Powers in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? In the ſixth Council at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Crab. Tom. <hi>2.386.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronius</hi> a <hi>Monothelite,</hi> in Confirmation of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, offered to raiſe up a dead man; but upon try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al he could do nothing at all, which made the people cry out, <hi>Novo Simoni Anathema, Polychronio ſeductori populi Anathema.</hi> The Emperor <hi>Baſilius</hi> being in great grief for his deceaſed Son,<note place="margin">Spondan. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. <hi>879.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Theodorus Santabarenus</hi> preſented his Son to him as alive; but this was but a meer <hi>ſpectrum,</hi> an illuſion of ſenſe: After a few kiſſes and embraces, the Emperor ſaw his Son no more. <hi>Apollonius</hi> did call up the Ghoſt of <hi>Achilles,</hi> that is to ſay, a Devil,<note place="margin">De Verit. Relig.</note> as the noble <hi>Mornay</hi> ſpeaks. <hi>Eliſha</hi> raiſed the <hi>Shunamites</hi> Son
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60626:63"/>to life, but he was only a Miniſter and a Type of Chriſt; the Power of God did the work: but our Saviour raiſed the dead by his own Divine Power. Another inſtance is, his reſtoring ſight to one born blind, <hi>John</hi> 9. Touching which the blind man ſaith, <hi>Since the world began was it not heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind,</hi> verſ. 32. It was a work fit for the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> It is indeed ſtoried, that <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Emperor reſtored ſight to the blind; but it may be the perſon was not really blind, at leaſt not naturally. Satan (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> well obſerves) might poſſibly reſide in his Eye, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede the uſe of that part, that he might ſeem to cure, when he did but ceaſe to hurt. But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour by a Power above Nature and Art, did cure one really and naturally blind, and that with Clay; a thing in it ſelf more probable to put out Eyes, than to cure them. And ſo there was, as the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi> ſpeak, <hi>Miraculum in miraculo,</hi> one Miracle within another; much as it was, when the bitter waters were made ſweet by ſalt, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.21. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance we have in his caſting out Devils: this was the Finger and Power of God. It is ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that <hi>Apollonius</hi> did caſt Devils out of Men: But how?<note place="margin">Rayn. de lib. Ap. Tom. <hi>2.</hi> fol. <hi>990, 991.</hi>
                  </note> It was in the very Method and Diſcipline of Devils, by ſuch words and ſymbols as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had preſcribed; ſo it was not an ejection, but a going out by conſent, to honour the Sacraments of their own making. But our Saviour did not caſt them out in their own way; but whether they would or not, by his Almighty Power. It is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be noted, that ſoon after the Death of our Saviour, the Devils Oracles were ſtruck Dumb. The
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60626:63"/>Oracle told <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> That the <hi>Hebrew-</hi> Child bid him leave that houſe, and be gone to Hell, no more anſwers were to be expected from thence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Auguſtus</hi> erected an Altar in the Capitol, with this inſcription upon it, <hi>Haec ara eſt primogeniti Dei;</hi> the Altar of the firſt-begotten of God. The Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical light made the Oracles ceaſe, the Prieſts of <hi>Delphos</hi> were brought to beggery. <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Morn. de Ver.</note> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting touching the ceaſing of Oracles, at laſt cometh to this point, That the Spirits were mortal, and by their Death the Oracles ceaſed. Oh! what an one was our Saviour, who made the <hi>Pagan</hi> Gods ſhrink and hide their heads? What a Divine Light was he who chaſed away thoſe falſe Lights? Theſe Works were for Greatneſs, ſuch as became God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the fleſh.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Miracles of Chriſt were excellently ſuited to the Evangelical deſign. Miracles in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nature are exceſſes of Nature, and therefore things very congruous to ſeal up thoſe ſuper-natural Truths, which are above our Reaſon. Evangelical Myſteries are ſuch as <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have they entred into mans heart.</hi> They are above the line of Reaſon, and ſo very aptly ratified by thoſe miraculous Works, which are above the line of Nature. We are in all Reaſon to conclude, that God, who acts above Nature, is to be believed, even when he ſpeaks above Reaſon; which, being but a part of Nature, may be as well exceeded by Myſteries, as other parts of Nature are by Miracles. But further, his Miracles had a ſpecial aptitude in them to confirm the Goſpel; they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, as the wonders in <hi>Egypt</hi> were, nor meerly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60626:64"/>to raiſe an admiration, as <hi>Simon Magus's</hi> were, who would preſent himſelf flying in the air,<note place="margin">Spond. Annal. <hi>68.</hi>
                  </note> frame walking-ſtatues, and make bread out of ſtones, that he might be eſteemed a great one, a kind of Deity among men: No, our Saviours Miracles were for the good of mankind; he went up and down do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good, he healed the diſtempers of men, and caſt Devils out of their bodies. And what works could be more admirably fitted to the Goſpel, which was ordained to heal inward diſtempers, and caſt Satan out of the Souls of men? What can better accord together than healing Miracles, and healing Doctrines? It is very reaſonable to believe, that he, who did ſuch wonders on the bodies of men, can do as much and more upon their ſouls. He, who caſt Satan out of the outward man, can eject him and all his furniture out of the inward. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is to be obſerved, that his Miracles were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily wrought upon Faith. Thus he ſaid to the <hi>Centurion, As thou haſt believed, ſo be it done to thee,</hi> Matth. 8.13. Thus to the blind men, <hi>According to your faith be it unto you,</hi> Matth. 9.29. Thus to the Father of the poſſeſſed Child, <hi>If thou canſt believe, all things are poſſible to him that believeth,</hi> Mark 9.23, as if the Divine Power were made over to Faith. We ſee here, how our Saviour in doing his Miracles, did put an honour upon Faith, which is the Condition of the Goſpel; and withal, what great reaſon we have to go to him for Spiritual Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, who hath done ſo many Corporal.</p>
               <p>The laſt inſtance of the Divine Power, is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the world to Chriſtianity, in raiſing up a People to God out of the ruins of the Fall. The
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60626:64"/>Son of God did not come in the fleſh, meerly to do Miracles upon the bodies of Men; No, his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt work is upon their ſouls. Corporal Miracles were pledges of Spiritual. Some of them, as the inlightning of the blind, and raiſing of the dead, did, as <hi>Eſtius</hi> obſerves, type out the giving of the Vital Principles of Grace,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Sent.</hi> lib. 2. fol. 337.</note> to reſtore the faln faculties in men. Some of them, as <hi>Peters</hi> walking on the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by the helping-hand of Chriſt, did ſhadow forth the giving of auxiliary Grace to Saints, to keep them from ſinking under Temptations. As the external Miracles were wrought by the Power and Spirit of God, ſo are the internal alſo. When a blind mind is irradiated, there is a word of Power, ſuch as at firſt commanded light out of darkneſs. When a dead ſinner is raiſed up to a Divine Life, the Glory of God may be ſeen in it, even as it was upon <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s coming out of the Grave. Now, that we may ſee ſome Rays of this glorious Power, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things are to be conſidered by us.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, let us look upon the ſtate of the World, as it was at our Saviours coming. The world was made up of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> both of them were not only tainted with Original ſin, but deeply corrupted with Actual; out of both God would raiſe up a Church to himſelf, to make the Power of his Grace known.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews,</hi> once Gods ſpecial People, were now deſperately degenerate; blindneſs was upon them, notwithſtanding that Rabbinical learning was at the height in the Schools of <hi>Hillel</hi> and <hi>Shammai:</hi> they interpreted the holy Scriptures, as the Vail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts would let them, in a very groſs, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60626:65"/>manner, as if they had loſt all ſavour of things Divine and Spiritual. Thus <hi>the eſtabliſhing the mountain of the Lords houſe in the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> Iſa. 2.2, is with one of them, the bringing of <hi>Tabor</hi> and <hi>Carmel,</hi> and ſetting <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> upon the top of them.<note place="margin">Buxt. Syn. <hi>c. 10.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The calling the ſabbath a delight,</hi> Iſa. 58.13, is to eat and drink, and indulge their <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> They made the Sacred Law, whoſe primary aim was at the heart, to bind only the outward Man. According to their corrupt gloſs, there was no Murder, but what purpled the hand with blood; nor no Adultery, but what was in the groſs Act: evil thoughts and purpoſes were not ſo much as <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadillo's;</hi> neither did God take notice of them, ſo as to puniſh for them. A thought or purpoſe of ſacriledg in <hi>Antiochus,</hi> was nothing with <hi>Joſephus;</hi> regarding or ſeeing iniquity in the heart, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with <hi>David Kimchi,</hi> as appears by his gloſs upon the <hi>66th Pſalm.</hi> Thus the Law was diſpirited and ſtrip't of its Divinity. Religion went off from its Center, the heart, to paint and varniſh over the outward Man. Sin might reign and do what it would within, ſo as it did not break out and profane the Life. Having thus humbled the Law according to their own Model, they ſtood upon their Terms with God: they would eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, though it were a poor cadaverous thing, without any Divine Life or Spirit in it; yet they would prop it up, and make it ſtand before God: they were full of their own Righteouſneſs, and compleat in themſelves; they looked only for a Temporal <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> one who by his outward greatneſs might ſubdue their Enemies, and feaſt them in the holy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60626:65"/>Land. A ſpiritual Saviour they expected not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could it be thought according to their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, what ſuch an one ſhould do for them. As for his ſuffering or dying for them, they jeſted at it as an horrible abſurdity, ſaying, <hi>Tobias deliquit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Weems <hi>of the</hi> Jew.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; ſigog plectitur;</hi> their own Temporal death was expiation enough for all their ſins. Hence the ſick man was to pray thus,<note place="margin">Buxt. Syn. <hi>c. 35.</hi>

                  <hi>Sit mors mea expiatio pro omnibus pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catis meis.</hi> As for regenerating-Grace to be procured for them, they dream't of no Regeneration, but a ritual one. The baptized Proſelyte was accounted by them as <hi>recens natus,</hi> one new-born. The ſick man, having but his name changed, was eſteemed as <hi>nova creatura,</hi> a new creature. As for Eternal life, they thought they could earn it by their own Works. In none of theſe reſpects would the pride of their hearts ſuffer them to ſee any need of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Saviour. Further, they advanced their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions above the written Word; their <hi>Talmud</hi> is, <hi>Lux illa magna,</hi> that great light, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.2. it is <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum legis,</hi> the foundation of the Law.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Li.

                  <hi>The words of the Scribes</hi> (ſay they) <hi>are more worthy than the words of the Law, and more weighty than the words of the Prophets.</hi> Thus departed they from the Scriptures, and run themſelves into a Labyrinth of Errors; the power and vigor of Religion was evaporated into rituals and empty formalities; if their Phylacteries were broad, it was no matter how narrow the Law or Obedience to it were. A clean outſide would ſerve the turn, though within there were nothing but helliſh pollution. Great vices might paſs, ſo as they were but <hi>ſub umbrâ virtutis,</hi> under a ſhadow of virtue; their honeſty was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60626:66"/>to thoſe of their own Religion, none elſe were neighbours with them: they might lye or deal falſly with a ſtranger, he was no neighbour; if they did kill a ſtranger,<note place="margin">Seld. de ſure Nat. <hi>Dr.</hi> Li. Harm. <hi>fol. 46.</hi>
                  </note> they were not to dye for it by the ſentence of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> he was no neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Nay, and among themſelves their <hi>Corban</hi> was able to untie the bonds of Nature, and free them from Duty and Charity to their very Parents; they ſeemed to be for cleanſing the outſide, yet they fell into groſs abominations. The very <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> their great <hi>Rabbies</hi> and Leaders, (from whom they were not to decline, though they were told by them, that their right-hand were their left) would devour Widows houſes: and what but frauds and oppreſſions could be looked for among the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſort? Indeed, among great and ſmall ones, there was a deluge of iniquity; they had made their ſins great, and to fill up the meaſure, <hi>they killed the Lord of life.</hi> This was the fearful ſtate of the <hi>Jews.</hi>

It's true, within they had an implanted notion of a Deity; without, they had the Creatures proclaiming their Creator. But alas, <hi>They held the truth in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 1.18. That little ſpark in their boſom, which revealed a Deity, was but a Captive; it could not break out to give Glory to its Maker, nor was it able to bear up the Honour of God in the World. They could not but know God, yet acknowledg him they would not: though he made and bear up
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60626:66"/>all things; yet they owned him not, no, not in his own World. They <hi>changed the glory of the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible God, into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed leaſts, and creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things,</hi> Rom. 1.23. And a little after, <hi>They changed the truth of God into a lye, and worſhipped and ſerved the creature more than the Creator, who is bleſſed for ever,</hi> Verſ. 25. They fell into all manner of Idolatries; any thing might be God, but the true one. An high diſhonour it was for them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the vileſt Creatures before the <hi>Optimus Maximus,</hi> the beſt and greateſt of Beings. An horrible lye it was for them practically to ſay, That a brute, or a man, or a ſtar was a God; or that a ſtock, or a ſtone, or a little dead matter in an Image, did reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the infinite Spirit. Upon their Idolatry, being an accurſed departure from God the fountain of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, immediately followed a black train of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: They were <hi>filled with all unrighteouſneſs, fornication, wickedneſs, covetouſneſs, maliciouſneſs, full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whiſperers, back-biters, haters of God, deſpiteful, proud, boaſters, inventers of evil things, diſobedient to parents, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful,</hi> Rom. 1.29, 30, 31. They were in theſe things, as in their Element, acting out of ſinful hearts and habits, and ſo gratifying their firſt and ſecond corrupt Nature both at once. And for all this they ſeemed to have a Patent from Heaven in the Vices of their gods, which their own Authors ſet before them; they did but follow their Deities, their ſins were made Divine by the higheſt Example. This was the ſtate of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:60626:67"/>
               <p>And now, what manner of Power was that, which raiſed up an holy People to God out of ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted a World? And how much work was there to be done about it? The light was to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded out of darkneſs. The blind minds were to be opened upon Divine Myſteries. The Law was to come forth in its pure Spirituality. The great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Chriſt and Grace was to be inwardly felt. Shadows were to be turned into ſubſtance. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was to be brought back to the heart. The muſty Traditions were to vaniſh before the Word. The old Idols to be caſt to the Bats and the Moles, thoſe blind Creatures. The fallen Nature was to be new-framed. The ſinful habits to be unravelled. Sinners twice dead in ſin, were to be raiſed up into a Divine Life. Here a very excellent Power was manifeſted. Hence the Apoſtle prays for the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, That they may have eyes to ſee it, that they may know what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead,</hi> Eph. 1.19, 20. The words are very magnificent, Power, mighty Power, exceeding greatneſs of Power, all working, and in act, as it was in the raiſing up Chriſt from the dead; ſo great a work is it to bring home ſinners to God!</p>
               <p>The Divine Power will yet be more illuſtrious in our Eyes, if we look upon the ſtate of the World in the great Men of it, ſuch as were great in Power or Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>The great men in Power, the Emperors and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of the World, were utter Enemies to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, breathing out nothing but blood againſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60626:67"/>the Profeſſors of it. <hi>Nero</hi> firſt kindled the furnace of Perſecution againſt them; he took occaſion, as pure malice uſes to do, from his own barbarous act; firſt, cauſing <hi>Rome</hi> to be ſet on fire, and then caſting the <hi>odium</hi> of that horrid act upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. He ſet forth Edicts commanding to perſecute them unto Death, as Enemies of mankind; which made <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſay, That it was <hi>grande bonum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apol.</hi> cap. 5.</note> ſome great good that <hi>Nero</hi> condemned. <hi>Domitian</hi> firſt ſlew his Brother <hi>Titus,</hi> and then blowed up the furnace of Perſecution againſt the Chriſtians. He ſpent moſt of his time in catching of flies, yet would not omit the Chriſtians. <hi>Trajan,</hi> no <hi>Nero,</hi> no <hi>Domitian,</hi> but in eſteem a pattern of uprightneſs, carried on the bloody work; he would not indeed have the Chriſtians ſought for, yet, if found, he would have them puniſhed. <hi>Antoninus Philoſophus</hi> was amiable to all others, yet cruel to Chriſtians. <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> though illuſtrious in Moral virtues, was ſtained with their innocent blood. Afterwards <hi>Maximinus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Si Tyberis aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendit in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, ſi Nilus non aſcendit in arva, ſi coelum ſtetit, ſi terra movit, ſi fames, ſi lues, ſtatim Chriſtianos ad leonem acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, <hi>Tert. Ap. cap. 39.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Decius, Valerianus, Aurelianus, Diocleſianus,</hi> turned their bloody ſwords upon them. The very name of a Chriſtian was crime enough; upon every ill acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Chriſtians were cryed out upon as worthy of death, as the only cauſes of the incumbent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity. Thus the Powers of the World, for the three firſt Centuries, though ordained for good, were Patrons of that great Evil, Idolatry, and utter Enemies to that great good, Chriſtianity: No Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in thoſe times could imagine to retain his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, unleſs he were willing to part with his life for it.</p>
               <p>The great men in Wiſdom, the Philoſophers of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60626:68"/>the World were Adverſaries to Chriſtianity; their Wits, as well as the Emperors Swords, were bent againſt it: outwardly they were in the ſplendor of Morality, and ſeemed to make ſome approaches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſtian Virtues; but inwardly they were black with Enmity againſt the Goſpel, and at a vaſt diſtance from the holy Temper of it. Many cavils they made againſt the Chriſtians, but the root of their Enmity lay in two or three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their carnal Reaſon would not ſtoop to the ſupernatural Truths revealed in the Goſpel: they were for Humane Wiſdom, but againſt Divine. Thoſe natural Truths which were within the ſphere of Reaſon, they looked on as Wiſdom: But thoſe ſupernatural ones, which were above it, they eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no better than fooliſhneſs; ſcorning that which they could not meaſure, and caſting that down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Reaſon, which indeed was above it. With them St. <hi>Paul</hi> was but a babler, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.18. one who had gathered up ſome vanities, that he might ſcatter them abroad to others. The Reſurrection was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mockery, <hi>verſ.</hi> 32; as if the limits of Nature could not be exceeded, no, not by the God of it. They thought that there was nothing in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrines,<note place="margin">Magd. cent. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>15.</hi> Fat. c. Graecos.</note> 
                  <hi>praeter ſtultitiam &amp; nugas,</hi> but toys and follies. That God ſhould be born a Man, was againſt Reaſon, a thing utterly incredible. That a crucified man ſhould be ſecond to God the Father of all,<note place="margin">Juſt. Mart. ad Anton.</note> was madneſs and intolerable folly. They thought that all the Wiſdom lay on their own ſide. <hi>Celſus</hi> could find much wiſer things in <hi>Plato,</hi> than in the Sacred Scriptures. <hi>Julian</hi> boaſted, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had all the learning,<note place="margin">Spond. Ann. Nazian. Or.</note> the Chriſtians had only
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60626:68"/>their <hi>Creed;</hi> as if Faith, which is a key to infinite treaſures of Wiſdom, were a poor inconſiderable nothing. Theſe wiſe men of the World would not be made wiſer than their own reaſon had made them, and upon that account they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the great Myſteries of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their corrupt hearts would not brook that ſimplicity and ſincerity, which the Goſpel called for: they knew well enough, that there was but one God; yet in their very Worſhip (in which, if in any thing, they ſhould have been ſincere and pure-hearted) they diſſembled, and made as if there were many, complying with the Idols of the place where they lived, and doing many things, <hi>Non tanquam Diis grata, ſed tanquam legibus juſſa,</hi> not as grateful to the Gods, but as commanded by the Laws. Hence St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of <hi>Seneca,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auſt. de C. D. <hi>l. 6. c. 10.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>Colebat quod reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debat, agebat quod arguebat:</hi> He worſhipped what he reproved, he acted what he found fault with: under all the beauty of Moral Virtues there lay a falſe heart, ſuch as could not bear a Command of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Purity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They were <hi>animalia gloriae,</hi> Creatures which lived upon popular air. Accordingly their deſign was as oppoſite to that of the Goſpel, as pride is to the Grace of God. That which the Goſpel aimed at, was, that Pride might be ſtained, that no fleſh might glory in it ſelf; that we might be ſaved by meer Grace, that God might be exalted therein. But the aim of the Philoſophers was quite contrary to this, they were lifted up in ſelf-excellencies: in all their Moral Virtues they did but ſacrifice to the pride of their own Reaſon and Will; they needed
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60626:69"/>no ſuch thing as Grace or Prayer for it. <hi>Quid votis opns eſt? fac te faelicem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca;</hi> What need of Prayers?<note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>31.</hi>
                  </note> thou mayſt make thy ſelf happy. Their fundamental maxim, the very firmament of their happineſs was, <hi>ſibi fidere,</hi> to truſt to themſelves; they would be virtuous, as <hi>Ajax</hi> would be victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, without the help of God, that the glory might be entirely their own. <hi>In homine id landandum quod ipſius eſt,</hi> that only is praiſe-worthy which is a mans own. Their <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> was <hi>Deorum ſocius,</hi> a Peer to the Gods: He did <hi>cum Diis ex pari vivere,</hi> live equally with them; nay, he did in one thing go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, they were ſuch by Nature, he by Virtue. This makes <hi>Seneca</hi> cry out,<note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>53.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ecce res magna, habere imbecillitatem hominis, ſecuritatem Dei.</hi> Behold! a great thing, to have the frailty of a Man, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of a God.

What room could there be for Grace, when Nature might do the work? What need that the Eternal Word, the brightneſs of Glory, ſhould be incarnate, when the little <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ſinall ſpark of Reaſon in our boſom, was enough to make us virtuous and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py?

               <p>We ſee here, to make men Chriſtians, was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable work, a great deal of Power was to be laid out upon it. Such a Faith was to be raiſed up, as might render them victorious over all the Power and Wiſdom of the World.<note place="margin">Veniant Crux, ignis, oſſium confractiones, modo Chriſtum bakeam, <hi>Ignat.</hi>
                  </note> Such a temper of mind was to be wrought, as might make them ready to welcom death in what ſhape or terror ſoever it came, and to pour out their deareſt blood and life for the Goſpel. Thoſe ſpirits, which before hung about Earth, and theſe lower things, were to be tuned for Heaven, and wound up to ſo Divine a pitch, that the whole world ſhould not be able to unbend them, to looſen them from Chriſt, or let them down into earthly Vanities. The great Emperors, with all their Engines of Power and Cruelty, could not rent them off from the World to come, or piece them to the preſent evil one. The Philoſophers, with all their Arts and Eloquence, could not decoy them from ſupernatural Myſteries, or induce them to take up their repoſe in humane Learning or Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The whole World was annihilated to them, and they unto themſelves; they became fools, that they might be wiſe, and Nothing that God might be All: the Ornaments and Self-excellencies were put off, that they might be compleat in Chriſt. They lay at Gods feet for Mercy, and lived in a continual dependance upon the influences of his Spirit and Grace. In ſuch a work as this the Arm of God muſt needs be revealed in a very eminent
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60626:70"/>manner. Here we have juſt cauſe to ſay, What hath God wrought!</p>
               <p>The Divine Power will yet more appear, if we look upon the inſtruments in this Work. In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the World there were none at all, no Leavers or Engines to rear up the great Fabrick. An Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty word abſolved it: in converting it inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were uſed; but ſuch, that by the no-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between them and the great effect, it might appear that the Power was of God only. He ſent not the glorious Angels to Preach up a crucified Chriſt, but Men. The treaſure was in Earthen-veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, in poor frail Mortals, who carried about bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Clay, <hi>That the excellency of the power might be of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.7; that it might be clearly ſeen, that the great Work was Gods. Among men he ſent not the <hi>Anſhe Shem,</hi> Perſons of Renown for Learning or Wiſdom, but mean illiterate men. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and the weak things of the world to confound the mighty,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.27, that the Divine Power might appear in the Work. Theſe mean men preached, <hi>not with excellency of ſpeech or wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.1, with the charms of Eloquence, or the pomp of humane Wiſdom; but with plain words: their Preaching was look't upon as fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. That ſalvation ſhould be by a crucified Chriſt ſeemed fooliſh; that it ſhould be communicated by Preaching,<note place="margin">Sclat. in Pools Synop.</note> ſeemed more fooliſh; that it ſhould be done by Preaching in a low, ſimple, plain manner, ſeemed moſt fooliſh of all. Yet in this way it was that Chriſt would ride conquering, and to conquer the World to himſelf. The great ſucceſs of their
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60626:70"/>Preaching, was a ſignal proof that God was with them of a truth. At <hi>Peters</hi> firſt Sermon three thouſand ſouls were converted unto God, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. and at his ſecond they were encreaſed to five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.4. multitudes of Believers came in to Chriſtianity. In a little time the Goſpel was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated over a great part of the World; one <hi>Paul</hi> ſpread it from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Illyricum:</hi> And what did all the reſt of the Apoſtles, who carried about this Evangelical light, do? What did the ſeventy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples do, who, as Eccleſiaſtical Writers ſay, had their ſeveral Provinces to Preach the Goſpel in? The word did then run, and was glorified; it paſſed through many Countries with a Divine ſwiftneſs and ſucceſs; at the ſound of the Goſpel the World was ſpiritually turned upſide down, and of <hi>Pagan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Chriſtian. <hi>Tertullian</hi> enumerates divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and at laſt adds touching us, <hi>Britannorum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſa Romanis loca, Chriſto tamen ſubdita ſunt;</hi> the Evangelical Power entred there where the <hi>Roman</hi> could not. By ſuch weak means to produce ſo great an effect, was a work worthy of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Divine Power will yet more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider the things propoſed in the Goſpel. <hi>Narces</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi>-General, diſcontented at the Empreſs <hi>Sophia,</hi> to invite the <hi>Lombards</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> ſent them many ſorts of excellent fruits from thence. The Preſent being congruous to ſenſe, the project took effect. The Goſpel indeed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes very excellent things to us. But they are ſo great, and ſo far above humane Nature, that the propoſal, if not accompanied with a Divine Power,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60626:71"/>would have been altogether ineffectual. I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in two or three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It propoſes ſuper-rational Myſteries, ſuch as the Doctrine of the Sacred Trinity. The Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Son of God. The Satisfaction made to Juſtice by his Blood. Theſe are objects of Faith, and ſo depend one upon another, that unleſs we believe the Trinity, we cannot believe the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and unleſs we believe that, we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Satisfaction; and without believing that, we cannot fulfil the condition of the Goſpel, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to reſt upon Chriſt for ſalvation. Theſe therefore are neceſſary objects of Faith; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Act of Divine Power, Faith in theſe cannot be had. Two things evidence this: the one is <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> the things are above Reaſon. As the things of Reaſon are above Senſe, ſo the things of Faith are above Reaſon: without a Revelation Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could not have found out theſe Myſteries, after it, Reaſon cannot comprehend them. It may ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow them out by ſimilitudes; but there is in them a light unapproachable, ſuch as Reaſon cannot look into; an infinite Abyſs, ſuch as Reaſon cannot mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The other is <hi>ex parte ſubjecti;</hi> man, who is to believe theſe things, is fallen, and in his fall not one or two faculties fell, but all of them; and among the reſt his intellectual and believing facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties fell alſo. The intellect hath loſt its ſubjection to God the Supreme Truth. The believing facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty centers in the Creature, and without the Power of Grace cannot lift up it ſelf to ſupernatural Truths. A Divine Power is requiſite, to captivate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to the firſt Truth, to elevate the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60626:71"/>faculty to ſuper-rational Myſteries. Hence in Scripture Faith is called the Gift and Work of God, ſuch an one as is the product of Divine Power: it is wrought by Power, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. it is fulfilled and conſummated by Power, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. it is ſtiled the <hi>ſpirit of faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. It is not from our own ſpirit, but Gods outwardly revealing the myſterious object in Scripture, and inwardly inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and elevating the heart to entertain it. Hence <hi>Fulgentius</hi> compares the production of Faith in the heart,<note place="margin">Carnem illam nec concipere Virgo poſſet nec parere, niſi e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſdem carnis Spiritus Sanctus operaretur exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum; in homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis corde nec concipi ſides poterit, nec au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geri, niſi eam Spiritus Sanctus infundat &amp; nutrint: ex eodem Spiritu venati ſumus, ex spuo natus eſt Chriſtus, <hi>Fulg. de Incar. cap. 20.</hi>
                  </note> with the conception of Chriſt in the Virgins Womb; both are by one and the ſame Spirit. Chriſt is no leſs formed in the heart by it, than his fleſh was in the Virgin. It is therefore a work of Power to raiſe up the mind of man to believe thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Myſteries, which are far above it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It propoſes ſuper-moral Virtues. It would have us to be humble and deny our ſelves. To ſanctifie the Lord in our hearts. To have a love for his Goodneſs; a fear for his Majeſty and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; a faith for his Truth and Mercy; a ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for his all-ſeeing eye; and ſuch a poſture of ſoul, that the inward affections and motions may in an holy manner anſwer and correſpond to one Divine Attribute or other. It calls upon us to have internal purity, to indulge no luſt, no, not in a thought; to baulk never an holy Duty, to love our very Enemies, and overcome evil with good. Theſe I call ſuper-moral, becauſe they are above the Power of Nature. Meer Moral Virtues may ſpring out of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60626:72"/>the Principles of improved Nature, but theſe do not do ſo. The Philoſophers, thoſe improvers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Maſters of Morality, never arrived at them. They were ſo far from humility and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, that Pride was their temper, and Self their center. Their ſplendid Virtues did not glance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but directly look at vain-glory. They did not ſanctifie God in their hearts, but ſet up their own Reaſon, taking it, not in its own place as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God, but abſtractively from him; they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it into an Idol, and ſacrificed unto it in their virtuous actions, doing them as congruous to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but not in reſpect to God, who inſpired it; or to his Will, which was declared in it; or to his Glory, which was to be promoted by it. They would talk of internal purity, but were indeed ſtrangers to it. Internal corruption was no burden to them; Regenerating-grace no deſire. They diſſembled and complied with the outward Idols of the place where they lived, and within, in the ſecret of the heart, they had their Idols and indulged luſts. <hi>Socrates</hi> had immoral impure corruptions. <hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Chryſippus</hi> allowed unnatural luſt. <hi>Seneca</hi> was in-inſatiably covetous. In the very beſt of them ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual ſins were but ſwallowed up of ſpiritual. The beauty in their life, was but to gratifie the pride in their heart, they knew nothing touching love to Enemies. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltion</hi> looked like a piece of natural Juſtice. <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us, <hi>Juſtitiae primum munus eſt, ut ne cui noceat, niſi laceſſitus injuriâ;</hi> they thought that upon injury they might revenge, or if revenge might be forborn, they little thought of love to Enemies. Nature, we ſee, cannot aſcend above it
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60626:72"/>ſelf, nor produce theſe Evangelical Virtues; the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power and Spirit muſt do it. Hence they are called <hi>the virtues of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9, as being far above the virtues of men; and <hi>the fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Gal.</hi> 5.22, as being produced by a ſpirit and power much higher than that of Man. Without a Divine Power it is not imaginable, how ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Virtues ſhould ever be found in the heart of poor fallen Creatures.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It propoſes ſuper-mundane Rewards, which are no attractives to a carnal heart, unleſs it be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated unto them by the Power of Grace. This plainly appears by comparing the heavenly Rewards and the earthly Man together. The Rewards are at a great diſtance from ſenſe. They lye in another world. The treaſure is in Heaven. The recompence is above. A red Sea of death is to be paſſed through before we can come at it. The Man, to whom the tender is made, is earthly, carnal, living by ſenſe, wrapt in the vail of time; one like the infirm Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Goſpel, who is bowed together, and can in no wiſe lift up himſelf, no, not to a Heaven of Glory and Bleſſedneſs freely offered unto him. He hangs in the Clay of one earthly thing or other, and by bonds of ſtrong Concupiſcence is faſtned to this lower world; and, which is a prodigy in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul, he loves to be ſo, and thinks that it is good being here. A little Earth with him, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Heaven. Senſual pleaſures out-reliſh the pure Rivers above. O how unfit is ſuch a man to cloſe in with ſuch a reward! How much work muſt be done to make him capable of it! The man muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earthed and unbound from this lower world. The
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60626:73"/>concupiſcential ſtrings, which tye him thereunto, muſt be cut, that his ſoul may have a free aſcent towards Heaven. A precious faith muſt be raiſed up, that this world may appear, ſuch as it is, a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, a figure, a nothing to make man happy; that Heaven with its beatitudes may be realized and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiated to the mind. A Divine Temper muſt be wrought, that he may be able to rent off the Vail of time, and take a proſpect of Eternity; to put by all the World, and look into Heaven. He muſt be a pilgrim on Earth, living by Faith, walking in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, every ſtep preparing for, and breathing after the heavenly Countrey. He muſt pray, work, ſtrive, wreſtle, watch, wait, ſerve God inſtantly, and all this to be rewarded in another world; without ſuch a Temper Heaven will ſignifie nothing, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Divine Power ſuch a Temper cannot be had. Hence St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>That God hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3, 4. The lively hope, which takes hold upon the great Reward, is not from the Power of Nature; no, 'tis from a Divine Generation, 'tis an heavenly touch from Chriſt riſen and ſitting at the right hand of Majeſty, from thence to do Spiritual Miracles, as upon Earth he did Corporal. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues, <hi>If you be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above,</hi> Col. 3.1. The natural man dead in ſin cannot ſeek them; only thoſe who are ſpiritual and riſen with Chriſt can do it. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from the Divine Power and Spirit, that men, naturally carnal and earthly, are made capable of cloſing with the heavenly and ſupernal Rewards, which are tendred in the Goſpel.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:60626:73"/>
               <p>The Power of God being ſo gloriouſly revealed, how humble ſhould our minds be? How ſhould our Reaſon kneel and bow down before ſuch a Myſtery as that, God manifeſt in the fleſh? There was a pattern of humility in the Condeſcenſion of it, and withal there was matter of Adoration in the Myſtery. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not, O man, to meaſure Divine Myſteries by thy Reaſon, which bears not ſo much proportion to them, as a little ſhell doth to the great Ocean. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, thy Reaſon is ſhort and finite: The Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are deep and infinite. If God could not work above the meaſure of Man, he would ceaſe to be God. If Myſteries were not above the line of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they would ceaſe to be Myſteries. When theſe are before thee, do, as an Ancient adviſes, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, bring forth thy Faith, ſubject thy intellect to the Supreme Truth, captivate thy thoughts to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, humbly adore and confeſs, <hi>That the Lord doth great things and unſearchable, marvelous things without number,</hi> Job. 5.9. This is the way to have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and eſtabliſhment, like the pious Man in <hi>Gerſon,</hi> whoſe certainty in Articles of Faith was not from Reaſon or Demonſtration, but from humiliation and illumination, <hi>a montibus aeternis.</hi> The <hi>Socinians,</hi> who in intellectual pride do <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, fight againſt God and ſupernatural Truths, loſe themſelves and the Myſtery together. But the humble ſoul, who ſubjects his Reaſon to God and his Truth, is rooted in Faith, and eſtabliſhed by Grace.</p>
               <p>Again, The Power of God being revealed in a way of Grace, How ſhould we look up to him by Faith, that he may do great things for us? He, who gave his own Son to come in the fleſh, can do every
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60626:74"/>thing for us. He can raiſe up Children to <hi>Abraham</hi> out of the very ſtones: He can melt the Rocky heart into Repentance: He can write his Law in the inward parts: He can make us willing in the day of his Power: He can ſubdue the moſt ſtrong and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate luſts: He can new-frame the heart, and draw his own Image upon it: He can make all Grace abound towards us, and ſupply all our need according to his Riches in Glory by Chriſt Jeſus: Let us look unto him and be ſaved. Let our Souls ever be in a poſture of waiting and dependance upon him, that the Divine Power, which was ſo eminently manifeſted in Chriſt, may in a meaſure be felt and experimented in us, that we, who are poor impotent Creatures in our ſelves, may be able to do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthning us.</p>

               <p>HAving ſpoken of other Attributes, I proceed in the laſt place to conſider the TRUTH of God.

                  <hi>quis falli timeat, cum promittit veritas?</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> He is true in his Commands; theſe are the counterpanes of his Will: he approves what he commands, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60626:75"/>what he approves. He is true in all his Works: the Creatures have firſt an Ideal being in him, before they have a real one in themſelves; they are therefore true, becauſe congruous to the firſt Truth. He is ſo true, that it is impoſſible that he ſhould lye. A lye, which ariſes from weakneſs or wickedneſs, can no more be found in him, than Weakneſs can be found in Power, or Wickedneſs in Sanctity it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Truth of God doth in an excellent manner appear in Jeſus Chriſt; He is the Complement of the Law, the Pearl of the Goſpel. The Truths of the Old Teſtament run unto him as to an Ocean, to be ſwallowed up in his Perfection. The Truths of the New meet in him as in the Center, to receive all their ſtrength and ſtability from him. The Divine Truth is manifeſted in Jeſus Chriſt ſeveral ways.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is manifeſted in him, in that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Predictions of a Meſſiah to come, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed and compleated in him. Two things will clearly evidence this:</p>
               <p>The one is this: It is plain that the promiſed-Meſſiah is already come: <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a Law-giver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him ſhall the gathering of the people be,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 49.10. <hi>Shiloh</hi> is the Name of the Meſſiah, the ancient Rabbins confeſs it: <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſaith one of them, <hi>ſhall not come till there be a clean riddance of Judges and Magiſtrates in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> had Kings in their own Land, Heads or Princes of the Captivity in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and after their return from thence, they had Governours and Judges: but now Government and Judiciary Power
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60626:75"/>hath been for 1600 years departed from them. The Meſſiah therefore is already come. Again, within the compaſs of the Seventy weeks mentioned in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9, many things were to come to paſs; The re-edifying the City and Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the coming and cutting off the Meſſiah, the confirmation of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the ceſſation of the Sacrifices; and after all theſe, the univerſal deſtruction was to enſue. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever theſe weeks be computed, yet it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that firſt the Meſſiah was to come and be cut off, <hi>ver.</hi> 26; and afterwards the Oblation and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was to ceaſe, <hi>v.</hi> 27: this being the true order of things in the Text, the Meſſiah muſt needs come whilſt the Sacrifices were ſtanding. If the Sacrifices under this ſecond Temple have for theſe 1600 years ceaſed, as they have, then the Meſſiah muſt needs be come many Centuries ſince.<note place="margin">Scho. Sacr. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put. <hi>10.72, 73, 74.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Franzius</hi> uſed this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to a learned <hi>Jew,</hi> who only returned this anſwer, Perhaps one week in <hi>Daniel</hi> might be one thouſand years. <hi>Franzius</hi> replied, If that were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Yet, if he thought that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s weeks were not expired, he would entreat him to ſhew where the <hi>Jews</hi> do now ſacrifice: ſeeing, according to <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Meſſiah was to come before the abrogation of the Sacrifices, it muſt needs be that the Sacrifices muſt ſtill ſtand in being, if the Meſſiah were not yet come. To this no anſwer at all was made, the knot being indeed too hard to be untied. Further, the Meſſiah was to come while the ſecond Temple was ſtanding; hence that of the Prophet, <hi>The glory of this latter Houſe ſhall be greater than of the former,</hi> Hag. 2.9. The firſt Temple had more of outward glory and magnificence than the ſecond. Under the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60626:76"/>firſt there were (as the Rabbins obſerve) five things, the Ark, the Fire from Heaven, the Majeſty, or <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinah,</hi> the Spirit of Prophecy, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and the <hi>Thummim,</hi> which were wanting under the ſecond: From whence then came that greater glory in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond? The Prophet tells us, <hi>God would ſhake the heavens and the earth,</hi> that is, do a very great work; the Meſſiah, <hi>the Deſire of all Nations ſhould come,</hi> v. 6, 7; His preſence ſhould put a greater glory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſecond Temple, than was upon the firſt. In the firſt there was the types and ſymbols of Gods preſence, but into the ſecond the Lord himſelf came in our aſſumed nature, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1, and ſo filled it with glory. This is the only tolerable account can be given of that greater glory: This ſecond Temple being long ſince deſtroyed, it muſt needs be that the Meſſiah did come before the fall of it.</p>
               <p>The other is this: Our Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> is the true Meſſiah; he is that ſeed of the woman who broke the Serpents head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15; no other ſeed, no meer man could do it; but the Son of God, being made of a woman, did <hi>deſtroy the works of the devil,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Partaking of fleſh and blood, he did through death deſtroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,</hi> Heb. 2.14. That firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made almoſt Four thouſand years before, was accompliſhed in him. He is that ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> in whom all the nations of the earth were to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. Never was it ſaid of any man but himſelf, That all Nations ſhould be bleſſed in him: Never was any man but he, who was God as well as man, able to turn that Curſe which lay upon the human nature, into a bleſſing. He is <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>Shiloh,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60626:76"/>Gen.</hi> 49.10; at his coming the Scepter departed: <hi>Herod</hi> an <hi>Edomite</hi> ruled over the <hi>Jews;</hi> and, to make himſelf the more abſolute, he ſlew the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin;</hi> in a little time all government was taken away from the <hi>Jews:</hi> Hence that outery in the <hi>Talmud, Vae nobis,</hi> Wo to us, becauſe the Scepter is departed from <hi>Judah.</hi> The temporal Scepter vaniſhed, but our Saviour had a ſpiritual one; to him, as to the true <hi>Shiloh,</hi> was the gathering of the people, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were converted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. He is <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prophet, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. never man ſpake as he ſpake; none but himſelf ever brought down ſacred myſteries from the boſome of God unto the world.

He is the righteous Branch, whoſe name is, <hi>The Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23.5, 6. No other man ſince the fall had righteouſneſs
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60626:77"/>enough for himſelf; but he had enough for himſelf and a World. He is the Meſſiah in <hi>Daniel;</hi> his blood made an end of ſin; his perfect Sacrifice put an end to all the legal ones. Under the Meſſiah there was only to be the Sacrifice of <hi>Thoda</hi> or Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. He is the Ruler come out of <hi>Bethlehem Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tah, Mic.</hi> 5.2. As God, his goings forth were of old, from everlaſting; as Man, he came in time out of <hi>Bethlehem:</hi> Never ſuch an one as he came from thence. He is <hi>the deſire of the nations,</hi> in <hi>Haggai,</hi> who filled the ſecond Temple with glory: The <hi>Man, Gods fellow,</hi> in <hi>Zachary;</hi> who was ſmitten for us, and in his wounds opened a fountain for ſin and for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs. The <hi>Son of righteouſneſs,</hi> in <hi>Malachi,</hi> who with enlightning and healing-beams ſhines into the hearts of men. The Promiſes of the Meſſiah are all accompliſhed in him. What the old Teſtament fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, the New exhibited. The reſpects and ſweet correſpondencies which are between the two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, clearly and punctually ſhew that Jeſus is the Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, here appears the truth of all the other Promiſes in the Goſpel, which are as ſo many ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructures upon the firſt fundamental promiſe of the Meſſiah.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P. Gal.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>The earth</hi> (ſaith <hi>Rabbi Eliezer</hi>) <hi>ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Tſadich, upon the righteous one,</hi> that is, upon the Meſſiah. I may add, Heaven and all the Graces which lead thither, ſtand upon him too. <hi>In him all the promiſes are yea and amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20: ſure and ſtable, as being founded upon his blood; hence his blood is called <hi>the blood of the Covenant,</hi> Heb. 13.20, as procuring it for us; and the New Teſtament is called <hi>the new teſtament in his blood,</hi> Luk. 22.20, as
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60626:77"/>being founded upon it. God is now obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Evangelical Promiſes, not meerly by his own infinite Veracity, but by his Contract with his Son, from whom he hath received a valuable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in his blood for the doing of it. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are ſecured by a double ſeal, God's Veracity and Chriſt's Blood; ſo they can no more fail, than the Truth of the one, and the Merit of the other. The Apoſtle argued thus: <hi>God ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things?</hi> Rom. 8.32. We may thus argue; If God would not go back, but perform the promiſe of the Meſſiah, which could not be done but at an expence ſo vaſt, that in the doing of it he muſt part with his Son out of his boſom, and his Son muſt part with his blood for us; how ſhall he not fulfil all other Promiſes? The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Meſſiah was the moſt difficult of all, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for God to perform, or for us to believe: the fooliſh builder lays the foundation, and is not able to finiſh; but the wiſe and true God, who laid the foundation of Promiſes in his Sons blood, will be ſure to accompliſh them; not one thing of them ſhall fail: upon what Promiſe ſoever we can regularly ſet our faith, we may take it as our own; all the bleſſings of it ſhall be made good to us.</p>
               <p>Further, we ſee here the truth of the Moral Law, that is made up of two parts, a Mandatory part, and a Minatory. The Mandatory part ſtands in Precepts; the truth of theſe conſiſts in this, that they are the Counterpanes of Gods heart, real copies of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving will; the matter of them is conſonant to his Sanctity and Rectitude, acceptable and well-pleaſing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60626:78"/>in his eyes: obedience to them is very grateful, and ſure of an <hi>Euge,</hi> an approbation from him. A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table evidence of this we have in our Saviour. It's true, the Law proves it ſelf to be divine, by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal Rectitude and Juſtice; but the ſin of a World lying as a cloud upon that glory, God would have it proved ſuch by obedience: no man ſince the fall being able enough for this work, the Son of God came down from Heaven to do it. As God, he could not be under the Law, but he aſſumed huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and with it moral duty: <hi>he was made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and ſo <hi>made under the law,</hi> Gal. 4.4, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected a greater honour upon it, than the being of all men under it could do. He perfectly obeyed it, and in his obedience the Law had its end, and an higher proof of its Divinity than it would have had if all men had obeyed it: None can now doubt that the Law came from Heaven, from the Father's boſom, when the Son of God who came from thence, did ſubject himſelf, and obey it. Never was ſuch a ſeal ſet to the Law as here; never did ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as he obey it. Here the Lord did magnifie his Law, and make it honourable, and that after a long and dark eclipſe put upon it by the ſins of a World. Here the <hi>Antinomian,</hi> who oppoſes the Law, might ſatisfie himſelf: The Law doth not condemn belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, but it is and muſt be a Rule. Our Saviour's whole life was a proof of it, and Commentary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and our lives ſhould imitate his, we ſhould tread in his ſteps, and walk as he walked; in both an homage is done to the Law. The Minatory part of the Law denounced a death and a curſe againſt the tranſgreſſor. It's true, here God acted by Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60626:78"/>he relaxed the rigor and letter of the Law, that the death and curſe might not fall upon the ſinner himſelf; but was the threatning totally neglected? was ſin altogether unpuniſhed? No, our ſins were puniſhed in our Sponſor Jeſus Chriſt. It's true, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> will not admit this;<note place="margin">De Servat. pars 3. c. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Quas nos dicitis Chriſti poenas, non vere &amp; proprie ſunt poenae;</hi> Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, however we call them, were not ſuch as were properly and truly penal. He would not have them properly penal, leſt they ſhould be properly ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. But I anſwer, Where ſin is not the impulſive cauſe, there ſufferings are not penal. Sin is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of puniſhment; there cannot be <hi>poena ſine fundamento;</hi> a puniſhment without a <hi>why</hi> or a <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> is a puniſhment for nothing, that is, no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But in Chriſts ſufferings there wanted not an impulſive, our ſins were laid upon him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. they were condemned in his fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. he bore them in his body, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. he was wounded and bruiſed for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. His ſufferings were for ſin, and therefore penal. Where meer Soveraignty inflicts, there ſufferings are not penal. What is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal is from Juſtice, not Power. What is from Power is meer ſuffering, not puniſhment. But our Saviours ſufferings were inflicted by Juſtice. Indeed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the Law, the introduction of a Sponſor, were acts of Prerogative and Supreme Power; but the inflicting of ſufferings upon our Sponſor, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of our ſins in him, were acts of Rectoral Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Jeſus Chriſt was ſet forth to be a propitiation, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, to declare, not the Dominion, but Juſtice of God. His ſufferings were inflicted by Juſtice, and therefore penal. But if they were penal, might they not have been ſomewhat leſs
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60626:79"/>than a death and a curſe? No, he bore both; God had a reſpect to his threatning: his ſufferings were, as much as might be, to comply with the terms of the Law. Though the threatning was not executed in a ſtrict rigorous manner in the firſt debtor, yet in an equitable way it was in a ſort executed in the Sponſor; he did undergo the eſſentials of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though not the accidentals. Thus the truth of both parts of the Law was manifeſted in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>Moreover the truth of all the types and ſhadows was ſet forth in our Saviour, who was the body and ſubſtance of them all: there was in him ſomewhat that did ſymbolize with them, and ſomewhat that did infinitely tranſcend them. <hi>Manna</hi> came down from Heaven, and ſo did Chriſt; but from the higheſt Heaven, the place of Gods glorious preſence, to give, not a temporal life, but a ſpiritual, an eternal one; not to one Nation only, but to a world: <hi>Ex hoc pane coeli ſancti reficiuntur &amp; Angeli,</hi> With this bread of Heaven Saints and Angels are refreſhed, as an Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpeaks. The Rock ſmitten by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and Chriſt ſmitten by the curſe of the Law, ſupplies the Church, not with earthly water, but with heavenly, with rivers of living gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and comforts; following believers not for a time, but indeficiently, and for ever. Hence the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins</hi> ſay, that the turning the Rock into water, was the turning the property of Judgment into the property of Mercy. All Mercies iſſue out from this ſpiritual Rock. The brazen Serpent was lifted up upon a Pole, and Chriſt was lifted up upon the Croſs; that healed the wounds made by the outward Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60626:79"/>in the body, and he heals the wounds made by ſin in the conſcience. The corporal cure came by the eye, by looking to the brazen Serpent; the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual one comes by faith, by looking to our Saviour for ſalvation. God dwelt in the Tabernacle and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in Chriſt he dwelt in the fleſh; not in types and ſymbols, but really and hypoſtatically; not for a time, but for ever. Chriſt is the true Tabernacle and Temple, who hath all the holy things in him. Here's the <hi>Shecinah,</hi> the Divine Majeſty appearing in our nature. Here's the Ark, where the Tables of the Law, broken by men, are kept inviolate. Here's the Mercy-ſeat, or Propitiatory, which covers our ſins, and from whence God communes with us in words of grace. Here's the vail, the fleſh of Chriſt, which hid his Deity, and through which there is a way into Heaven it ſelf. Here are the holy Lamps, the Spirit of Wiſdom and Grace derived from our Saviour. Here's the Altar of Burnt-offering, the Deity of Chriſt ſanctified his Humanity to be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſacrifice for a World: And the Altar of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, the odours of his Merit perfume all our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and render them acceptable unto God. Almoſt every thing did breathe forth Chriſt, and ſpeak to his Honour. He was, in one, all the Sacrifices, and more than all of them. Sacrifices began with the firſt promiſe of the Meſſiah, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head,</hi> Gen. 3.15: and after almoſt 4000 years ſtanding, they ended in his death: a ſingular reſpect they had to him, and a full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement in his perfect Sacrifice.<note place="margin">De Sacrif. Diſp. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Patriarchs (as the learned <hi>Franzius</hi> obſerves) uſed at the ſacrifices to ſpeak of the Meſſiah and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60626:80"/>his ſufferings: theſe being the ſcope and ultimate mark of all the ſacrifices, were not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them: A hint of them we have in that firſt promiſe of the Meſſiah, the ſeed of the woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15, who was to ſuffer a bruiſe in his heel, his human nature, that the Serpents, that is, Satans head might be broken. Thoſe Ancients knowing ſomething of Chriſts ſufferings, though imperfectly, and at a diſtance, did in all probability at their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices ſpeak of them. The believing <hi>Jews</hi> did not hang upon the ſhadow, the outward ſacrifices only, but look at Chriſt the ſubſtance and marrow of them; elſe they did, as it ſeems, worſhip God in their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices in an ignorant manner, without knowing the ſpiritual meaning of them: nay, elſe they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them up in a miſtake, in the belief of that falſe impoſſible thing, that the blood of Bulls and Goats could take away ſin: They knew that there was no remiſſion without expiation; they knew, that moral guilt did as much, nay more require it, than ceremonial; and if they knew nothing of an Expiating Meſſiah, they ſought no further for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of moral guilt, than the blood of bulls and goats. Now touching the Sacrifices, two things are to be noted:</p>
               <p>The one is this, there is ſomewhat in Chriſt which anſwers to the Expiatory Sacrifices. The ſacrifice was to be perfect and without blemiſh, that it might be accepted; the blind, or broken, or maimed, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted thing, was not to be offered up to God: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably, the human nature of Chriſt, which was the great Sacrifice, was without ſpot or guile; it was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Holy Spirit, and breathed out nothing but
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60626:80"/>ſanctity, that it might be a pure offering unto God. Had there been any blemiſh in it, it could not have been united to the Perſon of the Word, nor offered up as a ſacrifice to God for us. The Sacrifice, pure in it ſelf, was ſubſtituted in the room of ſinful defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive men; there was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the life of a Beaſt inſtead of that of a Man. Sutably, Chriſt the meek, patient, immaculate Lamb of God, ſtood in our room; he died for us, he gave his life a ranſom <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, inſtead of many, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28. His Perſon was put in the room of ours, and his ſufferings too in the room of ours. Had he not ſtood in our ſtead, he could not have been capable either to bear the ſtroke of penal ſufferings, or to free us from the ſame; not to bear penal ſufferings, he being nothing but meer innocency in himſelf; nor to free us from them, he being in no conjunction with us. The ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice being put in the ſinners room, had ſin imputed to it; they were to lay their hands upon the head of it, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.4: a confeſſion of ſins was made over the Scape-goat, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.21; their ſins were in a ſort transferred upon the ſacrifice, that it might bear them away. Thus it was with Chriſt, <hi>he was made ſin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>The Lord laid on him the iniquities of us all,</hi> Iſa. 53.6. Our guilt, as it was <hi>fundamentum poenae,</hi> was imputed to him ſo far, as to render his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings penal; and, as an Ancient hath it, he was <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lictorum ſuſceptor, non commiſſor;</hi> having no guilt of his own, he ſtood under ours, in order to a glorious expiation and abolition of it in his death and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Sin being charged upon the ſacrifice, there was <hi>deſtructio rei oblatae,</hi> a deſtroying of the thing offered: ſo it was with Chriſt, when our ſins were
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60626:81"/>laid upon him; with the Corn he was bruiſed, with the Wine and Oyl poured out, with the Lamb ſlain and roaſted in the fire of Gods wrath, and with the Scape-goat driven into the wilderneſs of deſertion, crying out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> His ſufferings were very many and great for us. The ſacrifice being slain, its blood did expiate ſin, an atonement was made, remiſſion enſued upon it: Thus Chriſt dying on the croſs, his blood was expiatory, our fault was compenſated, Juſtice was ſatisfied, wrath was averted, and God appeaſed and reconciled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. In theſe things appears a fair analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe ancient ſacrifices, and Chriſt the grea Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
               <p>The other is this: There is that in Chriſt which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely tranſcends all the legal ſacrifices. In the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice there was only a brute in perfection, but in Chriſt there was an human nature in perfection; an human nature which had the Spirit above meaſure, and was as full of grace as the capacity of a creature could hold: there was in his humanity ſuch a beauty and unmatchable perfection of grace, as far ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the united and accumulated excellencies of all the Angels in Heaven. The ſacrifice ſtood and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the room of offenders by conſtraint and compulſion, it was bound with cords to the horns of the Altar: but Chriſt ſtood and ſuffered in our room by choice and voluntary ſponſion; his ſoul was not ſnatched away, but poured out; his life was not meerly taken away, but laid down; he was under no conſtraint but that of his own compaſſion; he was tied with no cords but thoſe of his own love. In the private ſacrifice ſome particular ſin was charged
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60626:81"/>upon it; in the publick one, the ſins of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation were charged upon it: But upon Chriſt were laid the ſins of a World, ſins of vaſt diſtances, as far remote in place as the quarters of the earth, and in time, as the morning and evening of the world, met all together upon him. In the ſacrifice there was a meer ſimple death, and the blood was but the blood of a brute: but Chriſts death was not a meer ſimple one, but a death with a ſting and a curſe in it; a death with as much wrath in it, as was due to the ſin of a world; nor was his blood the blood of a brute, but the blood of a man, nay of God himſelf: and what manner of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was this! how compenſative for ſin! how ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to Juſtice! how averſive of wrath! how impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trative of all good! In every reſpect it was infinitely valuable and ſufficient. The Sacrifice <hi>ſuo modo</hi> did expiate ſin, it took away civil guilt, by freeing the offender from that temporal death which in the ſtrict ſanction of the Law was due to him. It took away ceremonial guilt, by freeing him from thoſe legal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities which excluded him from the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; hence the Apoſtle ſaith, That the <hi>blood of bulls and goats, and the aſhes of an heifer ſprinkling the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, did ſanctifie to the purifying of the fleſh,</hi> Heb. 9.13. Thus far went the ſacrifice, but it could go no further: the moral guilt was ſtill unremoved, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice was ſtill unſatisfied, the wrath to come was ſtill unaverted, God as yet was unreconciled; there was ſomewhat done to the fleſh, nothing to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ſomewhat in <hi>foro ſoli,</hi> in the Jewiſh Judicature, nothing in <hi>foro poli,</hi> in the Court of Heaven, to give a full ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice. Hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, that thoſe ſacrifices, though often repeated,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60626:82"/>could not make the comers thereunto perfect, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.1. The blood of bulls and goats could not take away ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 4. Still there was a conſcience of ſin, and a remembrance of it every year, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. Hence God reprobated all thoſe ſacrifices, and would have none of them; they were not rejected for the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie of the offerer, as they were <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.12, 13; nor comparatively as being in the outward work leſs than mercy, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6: But they were rejected as not able to do the great work, to expiate ſin; they were to vaniſh as Clouds before the Sun, as Types before the ſubſtance. But when Chriſt gave himſelf an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2, there was a penal, total expiation of ſin; not the fleſh but the Conſcience was purged, not ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, but Moral guilt was done away. Thus the Apoſtle, comparing his Sacrifice with the legal ones, ſaith, <hi>The blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal ſpirit offered up himſelf without ſpot to God, ſhall purge your conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>Emphatica omnia, &amp; totidem pene cauſae, quot verba, aeternae</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>per Chriſtum partae,</hi> ſaith the worthy <hi>Paraeus;</hi> all things in the Text are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical, and there are almoſt as many cauſes, as words, of the eternal redemption obtained by Chriſt. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, not as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to Devils, but to God; he offered, not as the Prieſt under that Law, a Sacrifice diſtinct from himſelf, but he offered himſelf: the thing offered and the Prieſt, beyond all parallel, were one and the ſame. He offered, not as the deceiver, a corrupt thing, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14; but his pure and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſelf, in whom there was no ſpot or blemiſh. He offered up himſelf, not meerly through an human ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60626:82"/>but through a Divine Eternal one; through his Divinity, which aſpired an eternal vigor and fragran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy into his Sacrifice, ſo that it needed not, as the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ones, any reiteration: <hi>for,</hi> as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>he hath by one offering perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.14. This is that great Sacrifice, more than all other ſacrifices, which ſatisfied Juſtice, expiated moral guilt, averted the wrath of Heaven, and procured an eternal redemption for us.</p>
               <p>Further, Chriſt was not only the ſubſtance of the ſacrifices, but of the High-Prieſts alſo. He hath the true holy garments, the graces of the Spirit: the true <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> lights and perfections. His girdle is Truth, his golden bells pure Doctrine, his anointing the Spirit and Power. He entred not with the blood of Goats and Calves into the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies here below, but with his own blood into Heaven, there to appear in the preſence of God, and bear the names of his people upon his heart. He is an High-Prieſt above all high-prieſts; not a meer man, but God, whoſe Deity poured out an infinite virtue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Sacrifice. He was not made an High-Prieſt only, but made ſuch by an oath; <hi>The Lord ſware, Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchizedeck,</hi> Hebr. 7.21. The <hi>Aaronical</hi> Prieſthood was temporary and of leſs moment, but Chriſts was unchangeable and of far greater moment; hence God pawned his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Life, Being it ſelf, to make it immutable for ever. Other high-prieſts died as men; but Chriſt, though he died as a Sacrifice, yet as an High-Prieſt he lives for ever: hence the Apoſtle ſaith, That <hi>he was a Prieſt after the power of an endleſs life,</hi> Heb. 7.16. His Deity made him an everliving Prieſt, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60626:83"/>an endleſs life of merit into his Sacrifice. <hi>He is conſecrated for evermore,</hi> Heb. 7.28. He is a perfect Prieſt, the efficacy of his Sacrifice is perpetual: the holy Unction on his head is indeficient, and ever run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down upon believers. This is the great High-Prieſt, the ſubſtance of all thoſe under the Law.</p>
               <p>Laſtly: The truth of Gods Worſhip is ſet forth in and by Chriſt. Though the truth and ſincerity of Worſhip were required under the Law; though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Worſhip as well as internal, be due under the Goſpel; yet the truth of Worſhip was never ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſet forth, as it is in and by Chriſt. This appears in three or four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The matter of Worſhip is now more free and pure than it was; the clog of Ceremonies and ritual obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, is now removed. Under the Law there was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Corn, Ordinances, a great number of Sacrifices, Circumciſions, Waſhings, Purifyings, Fringes, Feſtivals, Travels to the Temple, and diſtinctions of meats; but in and by Chriſt the yoke is broken, the carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances ceaſe, and all is turned into ſpirituality. Our Sacrifice is to preſent and conſecrate our ſelves to God, which is a ſervice highly reaſonable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no other than the right poſture of the ſoul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. Our Circumciſion is in the ſpirit, and a cutting off the corrupt fleſh of it. Our Waſhing is that of Regeneration and Reformation. Our Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying is that of Faith, which purifies the heart by the Blood and Spirit of Chriſt apprehended by it. Our Fringes are no outward ones, thoſe being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the Law in the heart. Chriſt is our Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over; the Holy Spirit poured out, our <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> Our Feaſt is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to do our duty, as one
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60626:83"/>ſaith: To delight in works of Virtue, as another hath it. There is now no tye to this or that place: <hi>Omnis locus viro bono templum,</hi> Every place is a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to a good man; Every-where we may lift up ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hands to God. Nor any diſtinctions of meat; <hi>To the pure all things are pure.</hi> The <hi>Levitical</hi> uncleanneſs in beaſts, did ſhadow out the moral uncleanneſs in men: <hi>Quod Judaei vitabant in pecore, id nos vitare oportet in more;</hi> What the <hi>Jews</hi> avoided in the beaſt, that we are to avoid in our converſation. If there be no diſcretion of things in us, the beaſt doth not part the hoof; if no heavenly rumination, it doth not chew the cud. An idle perſon is a fiſh without fins or ſcales, ſeldom in motion. An earthly man is a creeping thing, that goes upon his belly, and feeds on duſt. Thus in and by Chriſt Religion is refined, the load of carnal and ritual obſervations is caſt off, and Worſhip is brought forth in its pure and ſpiritual glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The mode of Worſhip is excellently ſet forth in the Goſpel. God, who is a Spirit, muſt be ſerved as becomes him, in ſpirit and truth: There muſt be a lowlineſs and humility of mind, a reverence and godly fear, an elevation and devotional aſcenſion of the ſoul to God, a filial love and obedience to his command, a ſingle eye, a pure intention at his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a divine fervour and freedom of ſpirit in the work, a faith in the great Mediator for acceptance, a waiting and holy expectancy upon God, that he would bleſs his own Ordinance, and irradiate the duty with the light of his countenance. It's true, this mode of Worſhip was known under the Old Teſtament; but it was never ſo illuſtriouſly ſet forth
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60626:84"/>as by our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. As a Painter, ſaith <hi>Theophylact,</hi> doth not deſtroy the old lineaments, but only make them more glorious and beautiful; ſo did Chriſt about the Law, by his pure diſcoveries he put a gloſs and glory upon the Divine Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The help to Worſhip is communicated in and by Jeſus Chriſt. The Holy Spirit, which firſt new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frames the heart for pure ſpiritual Worſhip, and then ſtirs up and actuates the holy Graces in it, is more largely afforded under the Goſpel than ever it was before. Under the Law there were ſome dews and droppings of it in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; but under the Goſpel it is poured out upon all fleſh. It was a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daical</hi> axiom, <hi>The Divine Majeſty dwells in none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Land of Iſrael.</hi> But after Jeſus Chriſt had by his ſweet-ſmelling Sacrifice purchaſed the Spirit, and in the glory of his Merits had aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he ſhed forth the Spirit in a rich and abundant meaſure upon all ſorts of men, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> Into what place ſoever the Goſpel comes, there the Spirit is at work to frame new creatures, and ſet them in motion, that God may be ſerved, <hi>not in the oldneſs of the letter, but in the newneſs of the ſpirit;</hi> that his Worſhip under the gales and ſweet influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit may come forth, as it ought, in its life and pure ſpirituality.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The great motive to Worſhip, the reward of eternal life, was never ſo manifeſted as it was by Jeſus Chriſt. It's true, holy men of old had ſome glimmerings of it; <hi>Abraham</hi> ſought after an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Country; <hi>Jacob</hi> waited for Gods ſalvation; <hi>Moſes</hi> had reſpect to the recompence of Reward; <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of ſeeing God in his fleſh; the believing-<hi>Jews</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:60626:84"/>could ſee eternal things in temporal, and meaſure Heaven by an Aſtrolabe of Earth. In their <hi>Ik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>karim,</hi> in the Articles of their Creed, there is one touching the Reſurrection of the dead. Thoſe Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents had ſome obſcure knowledg of life eternal: but in and by Chriſt it is ſet forth plainly and clearly, in lively and orient colours. Heaven, as it were, opens it ſelf, and in pure diſcoveries comes down and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches near unto our faith. It is now plain that the true worſhippers ſhall ever be with the Lord, ſhall ſee him and be like him; ſhall enter into his joy, and be ſwallowed up there; ſhall have a Crown of life, a weight of glory, and that to all eternity. All this is as clear as if it were writ with a Sun-beam: Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, That <hi>Chriſt brought life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to light,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.10: and again, That befor, <hi>the way into the holieſt of all was not made manifeſt,</hi> Heb. 9.8; that is, That light or manifeſtation of this Reward which was under the Law, was as none at all in compariſon of the pure and great diſcovery of it which is under the Goſpel. The ſervants of God need not ſay, What ſhall we have? The Reward is before them, the Celeſtial Paradiſe is in plain view, to attract their hearts into the holy ways which lead thither.</p>
               <p>In this diſplay of Truth, we have a notable proof of the truth of our Religion. Admirable are the harmonies and compliances between the two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the Subſtance, though but one, correſponds to the Types and Shadows, though very many. The Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah in the fleſh, notwithſtanding the vaſt diſtance in time, fully anſwers to the Meſſiah in Promiſes and Predictions. All things concur and conſpire together
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60626:85"/>to evidence the truth of our Religion. It was the obſervation of ſome of the ancient Fathers, That there is <hi>umbra in lege, imago in Evangelio, veritas in coelo,</hi> a ſhadow in the Law, an image in the Goſpel, the Truth in Heaven. Hence we may thus conclude, That Religion, which was in the Law in ſhadow, in a darker repreſentation; which is in the Goſpel in the image, in a more lively repreſentation; and which leads to Heaven, where is perfection of light, and eternal life in the thing it ſelf; That Religion muſt needs be true. Or we may go higher than the <hi>Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Law, and conclude thus: That Religion which in the morning of the World, immediately after the fall of man, appeared in the firſt Promiſe of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah; which afterwards appeared in types and more Promiſes; which after theſe, ſhone out illuſtriously in Jeſus Chriſt; which at laſt introduces into the perfect day in Heaven; That muſt needs be true. The ſucceſſion and harmony which is in theſe things, tell us, that infinite wiſdom did order and diſpoſe the ſame. Now after the Evangelical light is clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us, <hi>what manner of perſons ought we to be?</hi> How thankful ſhould we be that we live in the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning days of the Son of man? The <hi>Pagans</hi> are in groſs darkneſs, but we have the Divine light ſhining round about us. The <hi>Jews</hi> had ſome dawnings and ſtrictures of light; but we have the Sun, the full Globe of light: We need not now grope in the dark after happineſs, Chriſt the true light is come, the glory of the Lord is riſen upon us in the pure light of the Goſpel. How ſhould we believe and adhere to the Promiſes! God hath performed the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Meſſiah, and it is not imaginable that he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60626:85"/>ſhould fail in the other, which are but appendants to that great Promiſe. The Promiſes now have a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeal, Gods Veracity, and Chriſts Blood; and in all reaſon we ſhould ſeal them up by our faith; not to do ſo, is practically to ſay, that God may lye, or Chriſts Merits fail. In what truth and obedience ſhould we walk! No luſt ſhould now be indulged, no duty ſhould now be baulked. Every holy beam muſt be welcome, as coming from Heaven to guide us thither. Every Command of God muſt be precious, as being the Counterpane of his heart, and proved to be ſuch by the obedience of his own Son in the fleſh. Now to walk in darkneſs, is to reproach the holy light which ſhines round about us. To be falſe to God who is ſo true to us, is no leſs than hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ingratitude to him, and in the end will prove utter ruine to our ſouls; it being utterly impoſſible for us, while we are falſe to him, to be true to our ſelves or our own happineſs. How ſpiritual ſhould we be in worſhip! With what holy fear, faith, zeal, devotion, ſhould we ſerve him! Our ſpirits ſhould be conſecrated and offered up to God; our duties ſhould have warmth and life from the inward parts; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Spirit muſt not be mocked with a ſhell, a meer body of Worſhip. Jeſus Chriſt the Subſtance being come, we muſt not reſt in the ſhadows and rituals of Religion. God is real in promiſes, and we ſhould be ſo in ſervices. He will give us the beſt Reward, even Heaven it ſelf; and we ſhould give him the beſt we have, even our hearts, that he may dwell there till he take us up into the bleſſed Region, to dwell with him in glory; in ſo doing we ſhall at once be true to him, and to our own happineſs.</p>

               <p>HAVING ſpoken of the Divine Attributes, I now proceed to ſpeak of <hi>Providence,</hi> which in a ſpecial manner directed this great Diſpenſation, God manifeſt in the fleſh; in which, as we have ſeen, the Attributes of God do eminently appear. Providence is more than <hi>Previdence;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not nude Preſcience; it is, as a learned man ſpeaks, <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitio cum curâ,</hi> a Precognition with care. It is the Divine Reaſon of the Supreme Lord, which diſpoſes of all things; it is that act of God whereby he doth in eternity pre-ordain, and in time direct every thing to the great end of all, his own glory. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth very fully ſet forth this: <hi>Of him, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60626:86"/>through him, and to him are all things,</hi> Rom. 11.36: Of him as the Author, through him as the Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Director, and to him as the ultimate End, are all things. <hi>He giveth life, and breath, and all things,</hi> Acts 17.25. <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> ver. 28. The original, the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the guidance of all is from him. As a mighty Monarch <hi>he doth whatſoever he pleaſeth in heaven and in earth.</hi> Pſal. 135.6, <hi>He doth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth. None can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, What doſt thou?</hi> Dan. 4.35. All places are within his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, all creatures are under his government: <hi>Known unto him are all his works,</hi>

That the things in time may anſwer and go true to the counſels in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Providence works and watches over every thing; Angels are not above, nor Worms below the care of it. It reaches to the great Image of Earthly Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. It humbles it ſelf to hairs and ſparrows, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.29, 30. Natural Agents, though determined <hi>ad unum,</hi> cannot act without the concurrence of it. Free Agents, though upon the wings of liberty, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not flye out of its dominions. Meer Contingents, as the Lot, are aſcertain'd by it. In every thing it ſits at the ſtern, and moderates the event.</p>
               <p>The Philoſophers do, at leaſt in ſome ſort, own a Providence. Thus <hi>Theophraſt,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, There is a Divine Principle, by which all things both are, and continue to be. Thus <hi>Ariſtotle, What the Governour is in the Ship, the Driver in the Chariot, the Maſter in the Dance, the Law
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60626:87"/>in the City, the Leader in the Army, that is God in the World.</hi> Thus <hi>Tully</hi> argues; <hi>God is the moſt excellent being, and therefore muſt needs be Governour of the World. Plato</hi>'s Idea's exiſting in the mind of God, were, as is thought, no other than his Decrees. The Fate of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> is by ſome taken for nothing elſe but the Providence of God. Hence the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who denied Providence, in contempt called it, <hi>Anum fatidicam Stoicorum,</hi> the <hi>Stoicks</hi> foretelling old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

                  </gap>, or Providence, was Midwife to <hi>Latona,</hi> that is, Nature. The Creature, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo pregnant with power, brings forth juſt nothing without it.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Plotinus</hi> diſputes, That the Providence of God reaches to the loweſt things. The Flowers have their beauty from an incommutable form; the ſenſible World comes from that intelligible one which is with God.</p>
               <p>Reaſon evinces this Truth.<note place="margin">Si eſt Deus, utique Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens eſt ut Deus, nec ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ei poteſt divinitas at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribui niſi &amp; praeterita te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neat, &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia ſciat, &amp; futura proſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat. <hi>Lact. de Ird.</hi>
                  </note> A World without a Providence is a very great abſurdity: in ſuch a caſe how ſhould God be God? May he be an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mind, and without forecaſt? or a pure Act, and do nothing at all among his creatures? May he be every-where preſent, and no-where profitable? Or fill all things, and ſignifie nothing? May he be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Agent, and without an End? Or the Great <hi>Alpha,</hi> and forget that he is <hi>Omega?</hi> May he be Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all, and yet no Proviſor? Or Almighty, and yet not reign over his own World? May he be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Wiſe and Good, and yet neglect himſelf and his Creatures, his own glory and their good? Is it imaginable that ſuch an One as he ſhould frame a World out of nothing, and ſet it in delicate Order,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60626:87"/>meerly for Fortune to ſport it ſelf in, or to ſhufflle down into confuſion? And how then could the World be a World? Or how could it ſtand in order, or its parts hang together by links of amity? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hand and touch of Providence, Nature would jangle and be out of tune: without its glue and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the whole ſyſtem would unframe and fall aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a moment. If God, ſaith <hi>Bradwardine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Cauſa Dei,</hi> l. 1. c. 14.</note> ſhould ceaſe to be, there could be nothing paſt or future, true or falſe, poſſible or impoſſible, neceſſary or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent: ſo neceſſary is He. I may ſay, If God ſhould ceaſe to work, there could be nothing in all the world but perfect nullity. So neceſſary is his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>There are two great acts of Providence; the one is Conſervative, which upholds all: The other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinative, which directs and diſpoſes of all. Both are eminently ſet forth in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt act of Providence is Conſervative, and upholds all; the Creature cannot preſerve and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talize it ſelf, for then it would be a Self-ſubſiſtence, and a God to it ſelf: it ſtands <hi>juxta non eſſe,</hi> at the brink of nullity; and unleſs that Divine Power which brought it from thence into being, hold it up there, it naturally returns and falls back into Nothing as its Center. Preſervation is an influx of Being; and none but the Supreme Being, which is its own original, can afford ſuch a thing. It is a continued Creation, and none but he who gives <hi>eſſe primo,</hi> the firſt being to a creature, can give <hi>eſſe porro,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or protracted being to it. Should he withdraw his influence, or ceaſe <hi>continuo facere,</hi> ſtill to go on preſerving and new-making, as it were, his Creature,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60626:88"/>it would vaniſh into nothing; no creature could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin where he left, or carry on the work. Should all the Angels in Heaventry and put out all their ſtrength, to guard and keep up in being the leaſt particle of matter, and that but for one moment only, they could do nothing, they could not be Creators at ſecond hand, I mean in point of Preſervation. The Earth, being the Center of the World, ſeems to ſtand faſt, and yet without Providence it would waver into nothing. The Sea is a vaſt ſpreading. Element; and yet were it not in the hand of Providence, it would contract it ſelf into nothing. The Heavens are ſtrong bodies, and yet all thoſe glorious Arches, unleſs kept in repair by Providence, would fall and totter down. The Angels are immortal Spirits, and yet their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality is a donative and a continual ſpiration from the Father of ſpirits; the knot of their perpetuity is Providence, and without it they would break and diſſolve into nothing. Providence, we ſee, contains and preſerves all things: a great truth this is, but it was never ſo manifeſted as in Jeſus Chriſt. If ever any creature might preſerve it ſelf, one would think that the higheſt, nobleſt of all ſhould do ſo; his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature was lifted above the top of the Creation, above the higheſt Angel: It was, which never any Creature was before, aſſumed into the Perſon of God; yet it had no ſubſiſtence of its own, it did not preſerve it ſelf; it was held by that Deity which it did cohabit with in the Perſon of the Word: ſtill it was a Creature; it could not, like the Deity, ſpread it ſelf over the World: it was not a ſelf-ſubſiſtent or independent upon its Creator. Here we plainly ſee, that no creature, no not the higheſt, can ſupport
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60626:88"/>it ſelf in being without Providence. <hi>Ellhardus Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus,</hi> in his Book <hi>De Cauſa Mali,</hi> hath drawn a very ingenious Scheme to ſhew the dependence of the Creature upon God; he ſets the <hi>ſummum Ens</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt, under it the ſcale of Creatures in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, firſt Angels, then Men, then Beaſts, then Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, then meer being, under all <hi>imum nihil.</hi> As far as the <hi>ſummum Ens</hi> draws any thing <hi>ex imo nihilo,</hi> out of meer nothing, ſo far it aſcends the ſcale into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or life, or ſenſe, or reaſon, or Angelical perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: As ſoon as he leaves it, it ſinks down into the <hi>imum nihil,</hi> into nothing. This doth in a very lively manner ſet forth the dependence of the creature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its Maker; but it was never ſo fully ſet forth as in Jeſus Chriſt: His human nature, though above the whole ſcale of creatures, is ſupported by the Deity: No creature now may preſume that it can be a ſelf-ſubſiſtent, or ſtand upon its own bottom; all muſt confeſs a Providence ſupporting and bearing of them up in being.</p>
               <p>The ſecond act of Providence is Ordinative, it directs and governs all: God ſteers the ſhip of the World, and all the paſſengers in it: He orders the great Houſe, and all the Families of creatures in it. Providence turns every wheel in nature; and when there is a wheel within a wheel, intricacy and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing croſsneſs of motion; yet there is an eye in the wheel, a wiſe Providence which preſerves order in confuſions. All things are directed by congruous means to their proper end. There are millions of creatures which know not what an end is; but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence conducts them thither. Millions of Events are caſual as to us; but there is a certainty in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60626:89"/>Millions of acts are free as to us, yet Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath a ſoveraignty over them. In all things God is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the firſt Mover, and the laſt End; the wiſe Diſpoſer and ſure Moderator of every thing for his own glory. This great Truth is excellently ſet forth in Chriſt. Three things will make this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was a ſignal Providence over Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was a great Providence over the fruit of his Satisfaction, in raiſing up a Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All other Providences may be reduced to the other two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was a ſignal Providence over Chriſt. Gods eye and heart were upon the Temple, which was but a type; how much more intent muſt they be upon Chriſt who is the ſubſtance? Providence all-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long had an eye upon him: It watched over his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy; a deluge ſwept away the corrupt World, but <hi>Noah</hi> muſt have an Ark; the true <hi>Noah,</hi> the Meſſiah, who is our reſt and comfort, was to come from him. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s body, and <hi>Sarah</hi>'s womb, were both dead; yet there muſt be an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that the true <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the joy of the Father, may come in the fleſh from him. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was in a ſort offered up, that he might be a type of Chriſt; but not ſacrificed and actually ſlain, that Chriſt might come from him. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Tamar</hi> commit inceſt, yet Providence is not at a ſtand; no Medium is too hard for it; even this way come the Holy One into the fleſh. <hi>Ruth</hi> muſt leave her Countrey, and be married to <hi>Boaz,</hi> that <hi>David,</hi> and afterwards Chriſt, the true <hi>David,</hi> whoſe Kingdom was to be perpetual, might come from thence. The whole Scripture aims at Chriſt; but
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60626:89"/>the Book of <hi>Ruth</hi> ſeems to be penned on purpoſe to ſhew forth his Genealogy. The Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> was carried to <hi>Babylon;</hi> the Family of <hi>David</hi> was brought into a very low mean condition: but <hi>Judah</hi> muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again, the withered ſtem of <hi>David</hi> muſt bud and bring forth the Meſſiah, and that when it was in the loweſt ebb. The Lamp of <hi>David</hi> was almoſt quite extinct; but at the coming of the Meſſiah it was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a glorious Sun, which ſhould reign for ever. When Chriſt was to come, Providence took order that it ſhould be in due circumſtances, a long train of types and ſacrifices, ſuch as filled many ages, paſſed before his appearance. There was <hi>Gallicinium Prophetarum,</hi> the Cock-crowing of the Prophets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the riſing of this Sun. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> came a little before, to prepare the way of the Lord by Sermons of Repentance. At laſt he came in the fulneſs of time, in the prae-appointed hour, when the Gentiles were deſperately corrupted, when the <hi>Jews</hi> were hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly degenerate, then he came to heal the world. He was born in the right place. <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Tax calls up <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the Houſe of Bread, that there our Saviour, the true Bread from Heaven, might be born. He being God and Man in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Providence took order, that all along there ſhould be an appearance of Majeſty and Meanneſs: At his birth there was a Star directing to him, wiſe men worſhipping him, an Hoſt of Angels congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the good tydings; yet himſelf an Infant, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in poor clouts, and laid in a Manger. In his life he eaſt out Devils, yet was tempted; he healed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, yet was weary. The glory of Myſteries and Miracles brake forth from him, yet he was in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60626:90"/>and frailty of a man. The Officers a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, went backward and fell to the ground; yet he was apprehended: He was crucified through weakneſs, but liveth by the power of God. He hung upon a Croſs, but even there triumphed over all the powers of darkneſs. All which ſuits to God in the fleſh. Nothing more ſublime than God, nothing more vile than Fleſh. Accordingly in our Saviour there appeared a mixture of glory and weakneſs. To add but one thing more; Providence would have the righteouſneſs of his life, and the ſufferings of his death, to be ſuch as might be a full and ample Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the ſin of the world; and ſo it was. The righteouſneſs of his life highly honoured the rule of the Law; the ſufferings of his death were accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, as much as could be, to the curſe of the Law. Here the two great things, in which the Law hath as high a completure as could poſſibly be in a Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor on our behalf, that is, fulfilling the righteouſneſs, and bearing the curſe of the Law, were both emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently compriſed. Here the two great Attributes of God which called for a Satisfaction, that is, his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which perfectly hates ſin; and his Juſtice, which puniſheth it; were both gratified to the full. This Satisfaction, as obediential, pleaſed Gods Holineſs; as penal, ſatisfied his Juſtice; in both there was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour unto God. He was, at leaſt, as highly, if not more, pleaſed in it, as he was diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the ſin of a world. Thus there was, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence would have it, a very full and juſt compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for ſin, and withal a redundancy of Merit to procure all good things for us.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:60626:90"/>
               <p n="2">2. There was a great Providence over the fruit of his Satisfaction, in raiſing up a Church to God. The Son of God aſſuming our nature, and in it making ſo glorious a ſatisfaction for us, Providence would not, I may ſay (without diſparagement to its own perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) could not, ſuffer ſo great a thing to be vain, or to no purpoſe; no, it therein aimed at a Church: Two things will make this appear.</p>
               <p>The one is the Promiſes of God. He did not only ſay, That Chriſt ſhould <hi>be a light to the Gentiles, and his ſalvation to the ends of the earth,</hi> Iſa. 49.6; but in expreſs terms, That <hi>he ſhould ſee his ſeed,</hi> Iſa. 53.10: Which Promiſe having no other condition but his death only, did thereby become abſolute; it was as ſure as the Truth of God could make it, that there ſhould be a ſeed, a progeny of believers: And for the continuance of this ſeed ſucceſſively, remarkable is that promiſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>filiabitur, nomen ejus, His name ſhall be ſonned,</hi> or childed, <hi>from generation to generation,</hi> Pſal. 72.17: There ſhall from time to time be a company of believers coming forth as the genuine off-ſpring of Chriſt. Thus run the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and if God take care of any thing, he will take care to be true. If Providence (which without an aim is not it ſelf) aim at any thing in all the world, it will aim at the performance of the Promiſes; the keeping of Gods word being more precious to him than the preſerving of a World.</p>
               <p>The other thing to clear this point, is the End of Chriſts death, which is ſignally ſet down in Scripture. <hi>Chriſt loved his church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſauctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word,</hi> Eph. 5.25, 26. <hi>He gave himſelf for us,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60626:91"/>that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and puriſie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2.14. <hi>He died that he might gather together in one the children of God that were ſcattered abroad,</hi> John 11.52. Here the end of his death is plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and if Providence did not aim at the ſame thing, how ſhould the wills of God and Chriſt ſtand in harmony, whilſt Providence neglects what Chriſt deſigs? Or how ſhould Chriſt, after ſo vaſt an expence as his own blood, ever arrive at the intended end? To arrive at that by Providence, which Providence never aimed at, was impoſſible: to hit it by chance, was uncertain, and infinitely below ſuch an Agent as Chriſt, and ſuch a work as his Satisfaction. It was therefore the aim of Providence that there ſhould be a Church.</p>
               <p>Further, Providence doth not only intentionally aim at it, but actually procure it. And here two things are to be noted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Providence directs the outward means of grace: Theſe (which are things ſo great, that the Kingdom of God is ſaid to come nigh unto men in them) go not forth by chance, but by the Divine pleaſure; they are not hits of Fortune, but bleſſings of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and that in a choice ſpecial manner: Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical light doth not, as the corporeal Sun, ſhine every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: Supernatural dews do not, as the common rain, fall in every place: Providence directs whither they ſhall go. Hence the Apoſtles did not, at leaſt for ſome time, let out their light, or drop their heavenly Doctrine in <hi>Aſia</hi> or <hi>Bithynia, Act.</hi> 16.6, 7, but paſs into other parts. Their Commiſſion was general, to <hi>preach to every creature;</hi> but they followed the duct
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60626:91"/>of Providence in the executing of it. When <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Corinth,</hi> his ſtay there was proportioned to his work, <hi>God had much people in that city,</hi> Act. 18.10. There was a great draught of believers to be made, therefore the Evangelical Net was long, and after caſt in that place, as Providence would have it: So the holy light was ſpread abroad in the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Providence takes order that the Holy Spirit in the uſe of the means, ſhould ſo effectually operate, as might infallibly ſecure a Church unto God. Hence, beſides the light in the means, there is an in-ſhining into the heart; beſides the outward hearing, there is an hearing and learning of the Father: <hi>Cathedram in coelo habet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Epiſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> Tract. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>qui corda docet:</hi> He hath a Chair of State in Heaven, who teaches hearts, ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> There is not only a propoſal of objects, but an infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of principles, to aſſimilate the heart thereunto. The Goſpel <hi>doth not come in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.5. A Divine power opens the heart, unlocks every faculty, diſſolves the ſtone which is in it, imprints the Holy Law there, and frames and new-moulds it into the image of God; and thus there comes forth a Church of Believers, or as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>a church of the firſt-born which are written in heaven,</hi> Heb. 12.23, and all this is from the Providence and good pleaſure of God. Hence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That they are called according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and grace,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>That they are begotten of his own will,</hi> James 1.18. Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>That they are born not of the will of man, but of God,</hi> John 1.13. all is from the <hi>fo,</hi> the good-will and pleaſure of God. This Providence which watches over the Church, though it be a very
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60626:92"/>ſignal one, and next to that over Chriſt himſelf, hath not wanted Adverſaries. <hi>Socinus</hi> ſaith, That Chriſt the Head was predeſtinated, but believers the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were not.<note place="margin">Caput quidem certum eſſe debuit, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra autem non modo incerta eſſe poſſunt, ſed etiam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent. <hi>Praelect. Theol.</hi> cap. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Corvinus</hi> ſaith, That notwithſtanding the death of Chriſt, it was poſſible that there might be no Church or believer. <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> aſſerts, That Redemption might be impetrated for all, and applied to none becauſe of their incredulity. This Opinion to me is a very impious one. The Learned <hi>Junius</hi> obſerves upon that of <hi>Socinus,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an opprobrious and blaſphemous Opinion. The impiety of it appears in the foul conſequences which flow from thence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It puts the lye upon the Promiſes of God. He ſaid that Chriſt ſhould have a ſeed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10; and yet according to this opinion, he may be childleſs, and have none at all. He ſaid, That he ſhould <hi>have the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion,</hi> Pſal. 2.8; and yet he may have nothing. He ſaid that <hi>he ſhould reign for ever, and of his kingdom there ſhould be no end,</hi> Luk. 1.33; and yet by an utter failer of ſubjects he might not reign at all, and of his Kingdom there might be not ſo much as a beginning. He ſaid, <hi>That he ſhould be head over all things to the church,</hi> Eph. 1.22; and yet he may have no body; nay, nor ſo much as one poor member of it. Notwithſtanding all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60626:92"/>he may be a Father without Children; an Heir without an Inheritance; a King without Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; an Head without Members: And how can theſe things be! Or how can God be true to his word, which is dearer to him than the whole frame of Heaven and Earth! Neither will it ſalve the matter to ſay, That in the event there was a Church, and ſo much God foreknew: For if he foreknew it, it was a certain immutable thing. Meer Caſuals, ſuch as may be or may not be, are not the objects of Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If a Church might be, or might not be, as this Opinion would have it, it was not the object of Preſcience. If a Church would certainly be, then it is the object of Preſcience: but then this Tenet, that it might be, or not be, falls to the ground. However if we ſuppoſe a Preſcience, Preſcience is not Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: Neither, if there were there only nude Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, would the Church in the event be from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, would the Church in the event be from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but from Chance; and then the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is, Chance, which made no Promiſe, performs all; God, who made the Promiſe, performs nothing. He is ſo far from taking care about it, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it to the Lottery of mans Will, whether there ſhall be a Church or not. If the event hit right, yet God is never the truer; he never performed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he took no care about it; that thing, or rather Nothing, called <hi>Fortune,</hi> did order all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Opinion doth highly diſparage Chriſt and his precious Blood. Creatures, nay the higheſt of them, Angels, may fail and miſs the mark; they have <hi>ſemina nihili,</hi> ſeeds of vanity and defectibility in them: but for Jeſus Chriſt, who hath all the treaſures of wiſdom and power in himſelf, to fall ſhort of his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60626:93"/>end, and ſo, as it were, to fall from himſelf and his happineſs. For him to lay the foundations of a Church in his own blood, and to have nothing built upon them: For him to make a Laver of his own blood, and to have never a ſoul waſhed in it: For him to procure the Holy Spirit, and to have never a Temple for it to dwell in, is a wonderful diſparagement. The reflexion is in effect, as if he were but a meer man, not wiſe or powerful enough to compaſs his end, or compleat his work; as if his blood had no ſpirit or divine virtue in it, effectually to procure a Church and people to himſelf. All which are below and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely unworthy of him, and the great work in his hands. Every little ſeed in nature hath a body gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it; and yet according to this opinion, the Son of God might ſow his own Blood and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and have none at all. A cup of cold water gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in charity, hath its reward; and yet the Blood of Chriſt poured out in a tranſcendent exceſs of love, may want it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This caſts a foul blot upon Providence, that, ſuch is its accuracy, reaches to every thing in nature, even to ſuch minute things as hairs and ſparrows; yet according to this opinion it neglects Chriſts blood more worth than a World, and the iſſue of it. It was the horrible folly of the Emperor <hi>Domitian,</hi> to ſpend his time in catching of Flies, while he neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great things of the Empire. And what juſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology can be made for Providence, if it wake and watch over the Sun, Moon, Stars, Meteors, Beaſts, Plants, nay over the very Gnats and minute creatures, while it ſlumbers and sleeps over the ſufferings of the Son of God? How much more tolerable were a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60626:93"/>neglect of all creatures, than of that one concern, which is a thing of infinite moment! If we believe that Providence took no care about ſo great a thing as Chriſts death, how can we perſwade our ſelves that it ſhould reſpect the creatures, which are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely below it? A greater failure in government there cannot be, than this, to be accurate in trifles, and neglective in momentous things. Again, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence reaches to the end of things; it doth not go part of the way only, but conducts them to their end: yet according to this opinion, it doth not do ſo in a thing of more conſequence than all the world. It watched over the genealogy, birth, life, death, reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt; but then it made a ſtand, taking no care what the iſſue or fruit of all this ſhould be, after all was done: whether Chriſt ſhould have a Church, or ſo much as one believer in all the world, was not determined by Providence, but left to the Lottery of mans Will. A greater defect cannot be imagined than this, To do great admirable things, and then not to regard what ſhall become of them. I ſhall ſay no more to this opinion, but conclude, That a very great Providence did watch over the iſſue of Chriſts death, that a Church might be ſecured unto him. But becauſe it may be ſaid, That the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences over Chriſt and the Church are, though great, yet but particular ones, I ſhall proceed to the next thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All other Providences may be reduced to the other two. As God hath a ſpecial eye upon Chriſt and the Church, ſo he orders other things to be ſome way or other ſubſervient unto them. I ſhall in brief touch upon the reduction of other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60626:94"/>firſt, to that over Chriſt, and then to that over the Church.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Other Providences are to be reduced to that over Chriſt. It was an ancient ſaying of the <hi>Jews, That the World was made for the Meſſiah.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us expresly, <hi>That all things were created by him and for him,</hi> Col. 1.16. That Providence which was over him, being the Maſter-piece, the higheſt Providence that ever the Sun ſaw, muſt in all reaſon be the rule of the reſt, in that we have the nobleſt proſpect of God and the creature, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes ſet forth in their glory, and a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, an human nature, elevated to the higheſt pitch: unto that therefore other Providences are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. To give ſome inſtances: God permitted <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to fall and break his beautiful image of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all to pieces: and why did he permit it? doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he could have upheld man in his integrity; no man dares deny it: doubtleſs he permitted it not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationally;<note place="margin">Quis audeat credere aut dicere, ut ne<expan>

If any at all be given, I ſuppoſe a better reaſon cannot be given than this, That he permitted it, that way might be made for the coming of his Son in the fleſh: Hence that ſpeech, <hi>O foelix culpa, que tantum meruit redemptorem!</hi>

                  <hi>Certum eſt,</hi> It is certain that evil was permitted, that the Son of God might take our fleſh. But to go on: After the fall, the Providence which watched over <hi>Noah, Abraham, Judah, Ruth, David,</hi> with others the Anceſtors of our Saviour, did look
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60626:94"/>at that excellent one who was to come from thence: nay, that Providence which keeps the whole world in its being and order, reſpects him and his Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Juſtice would, if unſatisfied, have daſhed down the World about the ſinners ears; but it is preſerved upon the account of Chriſt: it ſtands not now meerly by Power, but by Blood. Redemption is a buttreſs to Creation, to keep it from ſinking into a Chaos. <hi>By Chriſt all things conſiſt,</hi> Col. 1.17, not only ſubſiſt in their beings, but conſiſt in their orders. The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and proſperities which Providence diſpenſes and doles out unto ſinners, are all founded upon him. It is obſervable in the Old Teſtament, that they uſed this order in praying for bleſſings, <hi>The Lord be with you:</hi> Thus <hi>Boaz</hi> to the Reapers, Ruth 2.4, <hi>The Lord be with you;</hi> or, which is all one, <hi>The Lord be with us.</hi> Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> in his famous prayer, <hi>The Lord our God be with us,</hi> 1 King. 8.57. The form of words falls in with the precious Name of our Saviour, <hi>Immanuel,</hi> or <hi>God with us.</hi> Were it not for Chriſt the true <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> God would not be with us at all to beſtow any bleſſing upon us; but becauſe he is with us in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate Word, therefore he is with us to bleſs us. It may alſo be noted, That the Mercies and Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which the <hi>Jews,</hi> Gods own people, had under the Old Teſtament, either had a type of the great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion graven upon them, or elſe had a type of the great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion graven upon them, or elſe had a promiſe of the Meſſiah interwoven with them. They were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but that was a type of deliverance by Chriſt. <hi>Joſhua</hi> brought them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but that was a type of entring into Heaven by Chriſt. God promiſed them deliverance from <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah;</hi> but the promiſe of the Meſſiah was interwoven with
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60626:95"/>it. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 14, he comforted them againſt a dark and troubleous time, but he uſhers in the promiſe of the Meſſiah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. All their temporal deliverances pointed to the great Salvation. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That God doth gather together in one,</hi> or ſum up, <hi>all things in Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 1.10. In him the types had their truth, the Promiſes were Yea and Amen. The Law had its end, all was ſummed up in him. In a word; all the Temporals in the World, all the Spirituals in the Church are founded upon him: He is the great Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where all things concur and meet together.</p>
               <p>Again, other Providences are to be reduced to that over the Church, as being next to that over Chriſt the moſt excellent Providence of all. The Saints, which make up the Church, are Gods Jewels. His peculiar ones, his <hi>Jedidiahs,</hi> or beloved ones, the Apple of his eye; a ſpecial Providence muſt needs watch over them: He is called the God of <hi>Abraham Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Cujus omnes gentes ſunt, quaſi trium hominum Deus eſſet,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> He, whoſe all Nations are, was the God of three men, a ſpecial care was over them; no wonder if other Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces carry a reſpect to them, they are graven upon the palms of his hands, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.16. In all the works which he ſets his hand unto, he remembers and bears a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them; the whole world fares the better for them. The Jews ſay, <hi>That the righteous are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, they bear up the pillars of it,</hi> Pſal. 75.3. <hi>Sanctum ſemen ſtatumen terrae,</hi> holy men do in a ſort bear up the world. <hi>Jacob</hi> tells <hi>Laban, That the Lord had bleſſed him ſince his coming;</hi> in the Original it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>at my foot,</hi> Gen. 30.30. Good men procure a bleſſing, and their Maſters are bleſſed at their feet:
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60626:95"/>remarkable is that in <hi>Moſes's</hi> Song, <hi>When the moſt high divided to the nations their inheritance, when he ſeparated the Sons of Adam, he ſet the bounds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple according to the number of the children of Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 32.8. When the world was divided, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not in being; yet a ſpecial reſpect was had of him, that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> ſhould have as much land, as ſhould be ſufficient for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who afterwards was to inherit it. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, that the 70 ſouls which went into <hi>Egypt</hi> were worth as much as the 70 Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world: to be ſure in proportioning out the world, God had a ſingular reſpect to his own people; nay, he reſpected them not only in ſetting the outward bounds of the Nations, but in limiting their inward deſires alſo. Thus God aſſures them, that when they came up to appear before him, no man ſhould deſire their land, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.24. For their ſakes Providence would not only keep off the hands of the Nations round about them, but ſtint their wills, and curb their very concupiſcences. The Apoſtle, to ſhew how great a ſhare Believers have in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, tells us in one place, <hi>That all things work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for their good,</hi> Rom. 8.28. The great plot of Providence is to make all ſerve them: and in another, <hi>that all things are theirs, whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come: all are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 22, 23, being joynt-heirs with Chriſt the heir of all things, they become in a ſubordinate ſenſe heirs of all. <hi>Fidelibus totus mundus divitiarum eſt;</hi> the Saints have all the world for their poſſeſſion, at leaſt ſuch a proportion of it as moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to their happineſs. If it were poſſible, ſaith
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60626:96"/>Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> for any Member of Chriſt to ſtand ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely in need of the uſe and ſervice of the whole Creation.<note place="margin">Van. of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turt, <hi>fol. 28.</hi>
                  </note> All the Creatures in the world ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly wait upon him, and be appropriated unto him. The Moon ſhould ſtand ſtill, the Sun go back, the Lyons ſhould ſtop their mouths, the fire ſhould give over burning, the Ravens ſhould bring him meat, the Heavens ſhould rain down bread, the Rocks ſhould guſh out with water, all the Creatures ſhould muſter up themſelves to defend the body of Chriſt. Thus that excellent perſon. One thing more, as a ſeal to all the reſt, may be noted, Chriſt the head of the Church <hi>hath all the power in heaven and in earth,</hi> Mat. 28.18. <hi>He is head over all things to the Church,</hi> Eph. 1.22. The Church is the primary mark and ſcope of his Government; therefore he rules with an eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and orders other things in a way ſubſervient to it.</p>
               <p>Having ſeen the Divine Providence manifeſted in Chriſt, I ſhall now conſider what Objections or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions have been made againſt Providence, and how and in what manner they are ſolved in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Epicurus</hi> denied a Providence: <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath no buſineſs, at leaſt not in the lower world.</hi> This he ſaid, as <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> obſerves, becauſe he would not have God to be Creator of the World; and if he were not Creator, how ſhould he be a Proviſor? The fundamental reaſon, why <hi>Epicurus</hi> denied a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, was, that opinion of his; that an infinite number of Atoms dancing in inanity, did at laſt by a fortunate chance meet together in a world. To this opinion a no-Providence beſt accords, a world made by chance ſhould be ruled ſo: Why ſhould God rule in a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60626:96"/>world not of his own making? But that opinion in it ſelf is very monſtrous and abſurd, Atoms did by good fortune make a world. But, as an ancient hath it, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde iſta corpuſcula?</hi> whence came theſe lucky Atoms? Are they Temporal or Eternal things? If Temporal, they muſt own a Maker whom they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: If Eternal, they muſt be invariable, that is, dance on in their inanity, and never ſit down in a world. How ſhould Atoms, if eternal, produce ſo imperfect a thing as chance; or chance, ſo irregular in it ſelf, produce ſuch an harmonious order as is in the world? May the blind Particles of matter rally themſelves into a world? or which way ſhould they ſink into an Earth, melt into a Sea, ſpread into a Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, inflame themſelves into a Sun, Moon, and Stars, and ſubtiliate themſelves into Life, Senſe, and Reaſon? It is far eaſier to believe, that Letters ſhould caſually caſt themſelves into an accurate Poem; or that Stones and Timber ſhould happily lay their heads together in a delicate ſtructure, than that Atoms ſhould chance to meet and ſettle in a world incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably tranſcending all humane Arts and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: And could a world be ſo made, how ſhould it be ſecured? Who ſhall clip the Wings of thoſe Atoms, or chain them to their ſeats, that they may not fly away from their bodies, and dance again in inanity? It being moſt rational, that a world made by chance ſhould be ſo diſſolved. Reaſon tells us, that in this opinion we have nothing but an heap of abſurdities; but Scripture tells us, That the World was not made by Chance, but by Chriſt the Eternal Word and Wiſdom of the Father; in whom, as the Schoolmen ſay, was the Eternal <hi>Idea</hi> of all things,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60626:97"/>according to which, as the grand Exemplar, all were made: The Eternal Wiſdom, which comprized all in it ſelf, produced all in time.</p>
               <p>Another objection which <hi>Epicurus</hi> made againſt Providence, was this: <hi>God, being bleſſed in himſelf, muſt not trouble or diſparage himſelf by taking care of theſe inferior things.</hi> But this is as great non-ſenſe as the other: What! can there be trouble in a pure Act, in one who can do every thing by a word of power, who needs only to ſpeak, and the thing is done? May there be a diſparagement in ruling over what he hath made? Are not theſe inferior things the works of his hands? If not, how came they out of nullity? If ſo, how doth he diſparage himſelf by ruling over his own works? If it be a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to care for them, was it not ſo to create them? Nay,<note place="margin">Non ſeciſſe nulla injuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, non cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſumma in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clementia. <hi>Officior.</hi> l. 1. c. 13.</note> as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> hath obſerved, not to make them was no injuſtice; not to care for them being made, is great inclemency. But the greateſt ſolution of all, we have in Chriſt; in him we plainly ſee the Son of God, very God, not only taking care about his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but (which is a condeſcenſion infinitely lower, though without diſparagement) aſſuming a creature, an humane nature, into his own Sacred Perſon. No man may now dream that Providence doth in the leaſt diſparage the Deity.</p>
               <p>Leaving <hi>Epicurus,</hi> I paſs unto another exception: There may be a Providence over ſome things, but ſurely not over the free acts of men. <hi>Epicurus</hi> thought ſome things too low for Providence; others think human acts, becauſe free, too high for it. Thus <hi>Cicero</hi> thought,<note place="margin">Auſt. de civ. Dti, <hi>l. 5. c. 9.</hi>
                  </note> that if there were a certain order of things and cauſes, human Liberty would be ſubverted; there would be no room for Laws, or Exhortations, or
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60626:97"/>Virtues, or Vices, or Rewards, or Puniſhments. This made St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> paſs that cenſure upon him, <hi>Dum vult facere liberos, ſacit ſacrilegos:</hi> While he would make men free, he made them ſacrilegious. Thus the <hi>Pelagians</hi> affirmed, That the will is deſtroyed if it want the help of another; That,<note place="margin">Jerom ad cte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiphont. <hi>c. 3.</hi>
                  </note> there being a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, God is no further neceſſary to us: indeed the <hi>poſſe,</hi> or power, is from God; but the <hi>velle,</hi> or willing,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt.</hi> de Grat. Chriſti, cap. 4.</note> is only from our ſelves. Thus <hi>Socinus</hi> diſtinguiſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the internal and external acts of men;<note place="margin">Pralect. Theol. <hi>cap. 7.</hi>
                  </note> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal are only in mans power, as not belonging to the adminiſtration of the world: the external may fall under Providence, but not the internal. <hi>Volkelius</hi> and others go the very ſame way.</p>
               <p>This Opinion to me is a very impious one; it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſparages Divine Providence: it is in effect as much as to ſay, God hath nothing to rule over but the Brutal World, the Rational is loſt out of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. It takes away the glory and crown of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which rules over free Agents in ſo rare and admirable a manner, that they, though moving up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wings of liberty, do infallibly hit the mark. It ſubverts the certainty of Providence, and that in thoſe things which were poſitively decreed by God, and of the higheſt moment to men. What more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively decreed, or more highly momentous to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, than thoſe two famous deliverances from <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon?</hi> Or what more poſitively decreed, or more highly momentous to the whole world, than the ſufferings of our Saviour? Yet theſe things being to come to paſs by the free acts of men, and thoſe free acts not being under Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the event muſt needs be pendulous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, as thoſe free acts upon which the event de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60626:98"/>are. Providence, having no ſoveraign domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over thoſe free acts, doth not aſcertain the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, but leave it dubious and fluctuating till the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Will determines it ſelf: And what is this, but to make Providence nothing, and man an independent Agent? And whither doth this tend, but to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſubverſion of Piety? We ſhould ſay in piety, <hi>If the Lord will,</hi>

Moreover, it directly contradicts Scripture. God touched their hearts, and <hi>Saul</hi> had a band, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.26. God opened the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and the Goſpel had entrance, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. God turneth the Kings heart, and that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.1. God draws men, and they come to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. God put it into the Kings heart, and the Temple was beautified, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.27. <hi>God worketh to will and to do, of his own good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2.13. None of theſe can be true, if Providence rule not over the wills and hearts of men: but that it doth ſo, is not only clear in theſe inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but in an eminent manner appears in Jeſus Chriſt;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60626:98"/>his humane Will was free, and yet infallibly guided by his divine. Hence he tells us, <hi>That he did nothing of himſelf,</hi> Joh. 8.28; nay, and that he could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. The divine Will incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the whole <hi>ſuppoſitum,</hi> and moved the humane, and that, as the learned Profeſſor ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>wards</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>fol.</hi> 120.</note> 
                  <hi>Non ſuaſoriè tantum, ſed efficienter &amp; phyſicè;</hi> that man therefore, who thinks his humane Will above Providence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes his Liberty to be above that in the humane Nature of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>But here it is objected, that if Providence rule over the Will, humane Liberty is deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Humane Liberty is ſo highly magnified by ſome, that they ſpeak very ſtrangely, touching the things of God. Hence <hi>Penottus</hi> dreams, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Decrees touching humane Acts, are not to be conceived as definitive ſentence, but as a pendent one, till the human Will have determined it ſelf. God muſt wait, till he ſee what Man will do. Nay, hence <hi>Schlictingius</hi> confidently lays it down,<note place="margin">Contr. Meiſn. de Praed. <hi>fol.</hi> 10.</note> that the infallible Preſcience of God infers a neceſſity upon humane Acts, as well as his abſolute Decree; that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, if granted, takes away all Piety. It ſeems, that man may be free, God muſt not only ſuſpend his Eternal Decrees, but part with his Preſcience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Thus preſumptuous is the pride of Man in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting his own Liberty; but for the thing it ſelf, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and humane Liberty do very well conſiſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Providence is not deſtructive, but ſalvative of humane Liberty: it impoſes upon humane Acts, not a neceſſity of Coaction, but of Immutability on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch as no way trenches upon the creatures Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Some, I ſuppoſe, will not admit that diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60626:99"/>but that it is a neceſſary one, appears thus. On the one hand it is impoſſible, that any act of mans Will ſhould fall under a neceſſity of Coaction; for then it ſhould will <hi>nolent:</hi> on the other 'tis impoſſible, that any act of mans Will ſhould come to paſs in any other way than under a neceſſity of Immutability. For whatever comes to paſs, before its exiſtence was future; and whatever is future, comes to paſs immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably: if it was not future before, it cannot come to paſs at all; if it was future before, it comes to paſs immutably; for a future cannot ceaſe to be future, till it come into actual exiſtence. But to paſs this, I ſhall lay down ſome Conſiderations touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of Providence and humane Liberty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is to be noted, that God is infinite in all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, incomparably tranſcending all creatures; that all creatures are finite, but as a little drop or duſt, a vanity or <hi>quaſi</hi> nothing before him. This Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in an humble heart, is able to ſolve even ſeeming contradictions. Gods immenſity, though as indiviſible as a point, comprizes the world without cruſhing the leaſt quantity together. Gods Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though an inſtant, environs ages without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the leaſt ſand of temporal ſucceſſion: And why may not Gods Will,<note place="margin">De Gen. ad Liter. <hi>l.</hi> 6. c. 15.</note> though in St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> phraſe it be <hi>rerum neceſſitas,</hi> comprehend created Wills with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its Decrees, without any violence or unkind preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon their liberty? God is infinite, the creature finite; infinite cannot but unmeaſurably tranſcend finite; finite cannot but be every way ruleable by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. Let us remember, that God is God; and if men deifie their own Free-will, that <hi>he is a God above all gods,</hi> Pſal. 135.5. And then the next verſe will
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60626:99"/>be an eaſie conſequence, <hi>Whatſoever the Lord pleaſed, that he did in heaven and earth,</hi> Verſ. 6. As the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are higher than the Earth, ſo his thoughts are above ours, and therefore the one may eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to encircle the other; to ſay, that the humane Will, without a damage to its liberty, is not ruleable by Providence, is to ſay, that infinite Wiſdom and Power have poſed themſelves in making ſuch a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as they could not govern without deſtroying its faculties: and to ſay, that the humane Will, though ruleable by Providence, is not ſo ruled, is to ſay, that the great King of kings, and Lord of lords hath voluntarily, and without any neceſſity for it, waved his Principality over his nobleſt creatures, over the wills and hearts of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Providence and humane Liberty ſhould conſiſt together, is neceſſary on all hands. On Gods part, that he may rule like a God over the nobleſt creatures; that the great things, which were to be brought forth through the free acts of men, might come to paſs, as became Providence, in a ſure and infallible way: on mans part, that he may act, though as a man rationally, yet as a creature dependently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God; that he may humbly acknowledg, that all his liberty is but a drop or little beam from him who is the fountain of Power, and therefore muſt hang upon him in its being and working. Free-will is a principle to his own operations; yet, as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpeak, it is <hi>principium ſub Deo &amp; poſt Deum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bon. in Sent. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>diſt.</hi> 25.</note> a principle under God and after God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſuavity and congruity of Providence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles the matter. God doth not ruin his creatures in the ruling of them, nor deſtroy his works that he
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60626:100"/>may fulfil his will, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſo applies it ſelf to every thing, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its nature.<note place="margin">Dion. de Div. Nom. <hi>c.</hi> 4. De Civ. Dei. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 30.</note> God ſo adminiſtreth all things, that, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Ipſa proprios exercere &amp; agere motus ſinat,</hi> he ſuffers them to act and uſe their own proper motions: <hi>he gave the Iſraelites favour in the eyes of the Egyptians,</hi> Exod. 12.36, yet he robbed not the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of their liberty: he touched the heart of <hi>Sauls</hi> followers, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.26; yet he crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed never a ſtring in their rational faculties: he raiſed up his peoples ſpirit to build the Temple, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. 5, yet he did not depreſs their freedom. Providence doth not operate by violent impulſions, but ſweetly accommodate it ſelf to the wills of men. Hence it may very well conſiſt with Liberty. It ſets down hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane events, and a congruous mode waiting on them; I mean, it orders, that ſuch things ſhall come to paſs, and come to paſs freely; ſo that it is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compulſive, that it is completive of humane Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Should ſuch things not come to paſs freely, the event would no leſs croſs Divine Providence than humane Freedom.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In Scripture Providence and Liberty ſtand in ſweet conjunction. <hi>God opened the heart of Lydia,</hi> Act. 16.14; yet ſhe opened her own heart to attend: he ſtirred up the ſpirit of <hi>Cyrus, Ezek.</hi> 1. 1, yet he ſtirred up his own ſpirit alſo. <hi>Titus</hi> went to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> of his own ſelf-choice and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 17, <hi>yet God put it into his heart,</hi> v. 16. The <hi>Jews</hi> did freely crucifie our Saviour, yet Gods hand and Gods Counſel <hi>determined it to be done,</hi> Act. 4.28. The <hi>Chaldees</hi> march againſt Gods People in violence, and in the pomp of freedom; inſomuch

In theſe and other Scriptures, Providence and Liberty are clearly, preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly aſſerted; both are true, both in conjunction. What if we know not how to join theſe together, or what is the mode of their conjunction? We are yet humbly and piouſly to acknowledg and confeſs the truth of both. God can do much more than we are able to ſearch into. <hi>Melancton</hi> uſed often to recite that of his Maſter <hi>Stadian,</hi> viz. <hi>I know both,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This objection is ſolved in Jeſus Chriſt: His human will was free, or elſe his active and paſſive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience was not meritorious or ſatisfactory; and yet his human will was infallibly guided by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, or elſe his Merit and Satisfaction were not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly determined. It's true, ſome have been ſo hardy as to ſay, That Chriſt might have ſinned, or not have obeyed his Fathers will. Thus <hi>Arius</hi> ſaid, <hi>Filium Dei fuiſſe</hi>

It's very miſerable that men ſhould have no higher thoughts of Chriſt than ſo. To ſay, That Chriſt might have ſinned, or, which is all one, to ſay, That he might not have obeyed, is to ſay, That there might have been a diſcord between the Father and the Son, a repugnancy between the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60626:101"/>wills in Chriſt: That the admirable Hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal union of the two natures in him, might have been broken and diſſolved: That his human nature might have loſt and forfeited the rich anointings and over-meaſures of the Spirit which were upon it: That the great work of Redemption and Salvation in his hands, might have failed and come to nothing: Nay, and that our glorious Redeemer and Saviour might by his ſin have ſtood in need of one to ſave and redeem him. All which ſhew the black blaſphemies which are couched in that opinion. To ſay no more of it, I conclude, That Providence rules over the free acts of men, and that without any violence put upon their liberty: Men act freely, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently upon God the primordial Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The next objection made againſt Providence, is this: If there were a Providence, How or which way ſhould it come to paſs, that the wicked ſhould proſper, and the good be afflicted?</p>
               <p>This objection ſtaggered the Heathens, that many of them denied a Providence upon this account. If there were a Providence,<note place="margin">Minucius Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix, <hi>f. 5.</hi>
                  </note> ſay they, Why had <hi>Phalaris</hi> or <hi>Dionyſius</hi> a Kingdom? Why <hi>Rutilius</hi> or <hi>Camillus</hi> a baniſhment? Why <hi>Socrates</hi> a Cup of Poyſon? When they ſaw bloody impure Tyrants ſitting upon the Throne, when good and juſt men toſs'd with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and expoſed to great afflictions, they hence concluded, That there was no ſuch thing as Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ruling over the world: Hence that of the Poet,</p>

               <p>Hence when <hi>Pompey</hi> in a good cauſe wanted ſucceſs, a ſad complaint was made, That, <hi>(res divinas multum habere caliginis)</hi> Providence, if any thing at all, was very dark. Nay, this objection was a ſcruple to the Saints under the Old Teſtament. Hence thoſe expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations, <hi>Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea are mighty in power?</hi> Job 21.7. <hi>Behold, theſe are the ungodly who proſper in the world, they encreaſe in riches,</hi> Pſal. 73.12. <hi>Wherefore doth the way of the wicked proſper?</hi> Jer. 12.1. <hi>Wherefore lookeſt thou upon them that deal treacherouſly?</hi> Hab. 1.13. A ſcruple they had, yet ſtill they held faſt this concluſion, <hi>That God was good to Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 73.1; and <hi>righteous in all his diſpenſations,</hi> Jer. 12.1. An anſwer may be made to this objection in many things; I ſhall only in brief touch upon them. It is a very good rule, <hi>Non eſt judicandum de operibus Dei ante quintum actum:</hi> This or that particular piece of Providence may look, apart and by it ſelf, as if it were irregular; but if all be ſet together, the reſult is nothing but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and harmony. The wicked proſper, but it is only in outward carnal things; within, there are ſouls deſolate and void of grace: It is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a little ſpan of life; in the end they ſink down into the bottomleſs pit of perdition. The good are afflicted, but it is in their body or outward lumber; within, there are ſouls florid and beautiful in grace: it is but for a ſhort time, in the end they enter into reſt and life eternal. The bleſſings which the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have, are good in themſelves; but to them, who take them, ſeparate and without God the Donor, they are but a lye, a vanity, a ſnare to their ſouls, and fuel to their luſts. The afflictions which fall upon
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60626:102"/>the good, are evil in themſelves; but to them who bear them in faith and patience, they are antidotes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, trials of grace; nay, precious love-tokens from their Father in Heaven. The wicked in their worſhipping of God, give him only the ſhell and outſide; accordingly he gives them the things of this world, which in compariſon to thoſe of a better, are but toys and trifles. The good ſerve God in ſpirit and truth; ſutably he <hi>makes them to inherit &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> Prov. 8.21; that is, thoſe ſpiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Realities, which tranſcend all the ſhadows and pompous apparitions of the world. The wicked are creatures, and ſo have a portion in this life; yet in the midſt of all their proſperity, they move to that Hell which is the center of their iniquity. The good are ſinners, and ſo have ſome afflictions to purge out the reliques of ſin; yet in the midſt of their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles they paſs on to that Heaven which is the center of their fanctity. If the wicked ſhould have nothing but adverſity, it would look as if there were no judgment to come, no after-reckoning for their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. If the good ſhould have nothing but proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it would ſeem to hint, as if their reward were only here; as if there were no ſuch things as Heaven and Life-eternal reſerved for them. The wicked proſper that we might not ſet too high a rate or value upon thoſe outward things, which the vileſt and baſeſt of men enjoy. The good are afflicted, that the Crowns and Recompences of Holineſs might appear to lye, not in this vale of tears, but in that Region where there is perfect bleſſedneſs. But, pretermitting all theſe, we have an eminent ſolution of this ſcruple in our Lord Chriſt; What an excellent one was he?
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60626:102"/>What a pure innocent lamb! how meek, humble, holy, harmleſs, merciful, zealous, heavenly, obedient, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent was he! how fair and lovely in all Graces was he? what a divine light and luſtre did his Virtues caſt forth into the World! how attractive and raviſhing were the Perfections ſhining out in him! What Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons did he preach! What Cures did he do! What was his life but a continual doing of good! Who, where is the man that ever was ſo profitable to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or ſo obliged the World as he did! And yet how was he uſed! What entertainment did he meet withal here! He was deſpiſed, rejected, a man of ſorrows, acquainted with griefs; extreme poor, not having where to lay his head: at laſt he was arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, falſly accuſed, unjuſtly condemned, ſpit upon, buffeted, mocked, nailed to a tormenting Croſs, there to breathe out his laſt. Never did Innocency ſo ſuffer as here, and yet never did Providence ſhew it ſelf in ſuch glory, in and by the ſufferings of this Holy One; the great work of Redemption was accompliſhed; his Stripes were healing ones; his Blood a laver to waſh ſinners; his Croſs was a triumphant conqueſt over Death and Hell; his Sacrifice made a perfect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement; his Sufferings anſwered for the ſin and ſuffering of a World. His ſorrows made way for good tydings; his ſhame procured glory for us; his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation was in order to our abſolution; his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty was to enrich us with grace and glory. This was the very Maſterpiece of Providence; never did the Sun ſee ſuch an incomparable deſign as here, out of death comes life; out of the ſufferings of an holy righteous perſon, riſes up an eternal ſpring of bleſſings and all good things.</p>

               <p>The laſt Objection made againſt Providence is this: If there is a Providence, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; whence is that greateſt of evils, ſin? Providence rightly and wiſely diſpoſes of things, ſin is an horrible and monſtrous ataxy and confuſion, ſuch as makes the Earth without form and void, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.23. as if the old Chaos were come again; and how comes it to paſs that ſuch an inordinate thing ſhould be in the world? It was the Objection of <hi>Marcion,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Si Deus bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, &amp; praeſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ſuturi, &amp; avertendi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li potens, cur hominem &amp; quidem ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem ſuam paſſus eſt labi. <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In anſwer to this Objection, it is to be premiſed, That God is not, nor cannot be the author of ſin: God is light, ſin darkneſs; God purity, ſin unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; God omnipotency, ſin imbecillity; God a pure act, ſin a defect. Sin cannot be from ſuch an one as he is; nevertheleſs it is clear that ſinful actions do not fall out altogether without a Providence. The Scripture is very pregnant herein: <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren ſell him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Egypt,</hi> but God ſent him thither, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.5. <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi> curſed <hi>David,</hi> but God bid him do ſo, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11. <hi>Abſalom</hi> lies with his Fathers Concubines, but God ſaid, I will do it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.12. a lying ſpirit deceived <hi>Ahab,</hi> but God ſaid, Go and do ſo, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.22. Thus and much more ſaith the holy Book, but neither is Reaſon ſilent herein; I ſhall therefore offer two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was a determinate Verity, and that before the event, that ſuch and ſuch ſinful actions ſhould come to paſs; a Verity it could not be without a Providential purpoſe, for then it would be an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, ſelf-originated, unpreventable truth; the thing muſt come to paſs whether God would or no:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60626:103"/>That which is of it ſelf, and a kind of origine to it ſelf, can have no impediment; it will exiſt and be a kind of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or ſelf-ſubſiſtent: to avoid which abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities I take it to be neceſſary to ſay, that ſuch a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity cannot be without a Providence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The greater number of humane actions are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and if all theſe were exempt from Providence, how could Providence rule the World? If God were the author of ſin, he could not judg the world; becauſe he could not be author and ultor <hi>reſpectu ejuſdem;</hi> but if ſin fall out without a Providence, he could not rule the World, becauſe the major part of humane actions are evil.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing it is certain, that Providence is for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and order, and that ſin is an ataxy and confuſion, I ſhall give a more diſtinct anſwer to this Objection; and here the light muſt be divided from the darkneſs. In a ſinful action there are three things conſiderable. I mean the anomy, or ataxy, the entity, &amp; the order of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The anomy or ataxy is meer darkneſs, it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and only from a deficient agent; it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the expreſſion is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. of a mans own: <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura habet redire ad non eſſe a ſe,</hi> the creature falls from its defectibility and pravity; here Providence is only a permiſſor; on the one hand it is certain, that no ſin can poſſibly come to paſs without a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. If God ſuffer it not, no man can wrong <hi>Iſrael, Pſal.</hi> 105.14. And, which is leſs than an injurious act, <hi>Balaam</hi> cannot curſe her, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.38. And, which is yet leſs than a curſing word, the Idolatrous Nations cannot deſire her Land, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.24. Let a man be in never ſo great a phrenſie of luſt, God can hedg and wall him up that he ſhall not find
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60626:104"/>his paths. On the other hand it is certain, that God is only a permiſſor of the anomy or ataxy, it is not from him as a cauſe: the creature being defectible in it ſelf, and under a law diſtinct from it ſelf, may fail and fall ſhort of the rule; but God who hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther law but his perfection, and can no more decline from his rectitude than his being, is a meer permiſſor.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The entity in a ſinful action, though coexiſtent with the anomy, is to be diſtinguiſhed from it; beſides the anomy there is <hi>aliquid naturae,</hi> ſomewhat of poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive being. This I think is clear: though an act as it reſpects the law, and is <hi>in linea morali,</hi> may be ſinful; yet as it is an act, and conſidered <hi>in lineâ phyſicâ,</hi> it cannot be ſuch; for ſo it is but the meer complement of a natural faculty, and that complement cannot in it ſelf be ſinful, becauſe the God of nature cannot be the author of ſin. The anomy or ſinfulneſs dwells not alone, but in <hi>alieno fundo,</hi> in ſome natural good. Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſinfulneſs is an inmate in the natural faculties; actual ſinfulneſs is an inmate in ſome action or motion. The action is inordinate, but it is not the inordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the inordination is a privation, but the act is not ſo; the act is a poſitive thing, but the inordination is not ſo; the act is the ſubject of the inordination, therefore it is not the very inordination it ſelf. Now there being ſuch a diſtinction in ſinful actions between the entity and the anomy, the entity or motion muſt be from God the firſt being and mover. <hi>Arminius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would have it, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t totus actus rite Providentiae ſubjiciatur, quâ actus efficienti, quâ peccatum permittenti Providentiae.</hi> As to the malice Providence permits, but as to the action or motion it operates; no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of being can be produced without it, ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60626:104"/>as are by illegitimate generation, are doubtleſs Gods creatures, and that becauſe the generating act, as it is an act, is from God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The order is conſiderable: In ſinful actions all is not meer ataxy; God hath an holy Line in the midſt of the diſorder. In Monſters there are aberrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of particular natures, yet Providence is not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. In ſins, which are moral monſtroſities, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-creature is inordinate; yet Providence is not without an order touching the ſame. And here we may take notice of a double order; the one looks backwards, and that is the Order of Penalty: The other looks forward, and that is the Order of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducibility. I ſhall a little touch upon each of theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Order of Penalty is conſiderable, and that under a double notion; the one is this: A ſinful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is <hi>poena ſibiipſi,</hi> a puniſhment to it ſelf. <hi>Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſti, Domine, &amp; ſic eſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auſt.</hi> Conſ. l. 1. cap. 12. Lib. 2. Diſt. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>ut poena ſibi ſit omnis inordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus animus;</hi> An inordinate mind is a puniſhment to it ſelf. Sin (ſaith the ſubtil <hi>Scotus</hi>) as it is fluent from the will, is ſin; but as it is reſident in the will, it is puniſhment. Or thus: As it fights and wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law, it is ſin; but as it debaſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turpates the ſoul in its beauty and ſerenity, it is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. A man cannot ſin againſt God, but he wrongs his ſoul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.36. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> cannot make Idols againſt God, but ſhe doth it againſt her ſelf too, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.3. in reſpect of this penalty. God doth not ſuffer <hi>dedecus peccati eſſe ſine decore juſtitiae,</hi> no not for a moment. The other is this; One ſin is a puniſhment to another precedent. In general, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us, That between the firſt ſin of Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60626:105"/>and the laſt puniſhment of eternal fire, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle things are ſins and puniſhments. Sometimes the ſin of one perſon is a puniſhment to the precedent ſin of another. <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery was puniſhed with <hi>Abſoloms</hi> Inceſt; <hi>Solomons</hi> Idolatry with <hi>Rehoboams</hi> Folly. Sometimes the ſubſequent ſin of a perſon, is a puniſhment to his precedent ſin. The Gentiles were idolatrous, and God gave them up to vile affections, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26. Men love not the truth, and God ſends them ſtrong deluſions, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.11. In all which inſtances, <hi>Peccatum non Dei eſt, ſed judicium;</hi> The ſin is man's, the judgment God's.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an Order of Conducibility to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.<note place="margin">Enchir. c. 100.</note> God permits not a ſin irrationally: <hi>Non ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neret bonus fieri male</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>niſi Omnipotens etiam de Malo facere poſſet bene;</hi> The Good God would not ſuffer evil to be done, unleſs he could by his Omnipotency bring good out of it.<note place="margin">De Cauſa Dei, c. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Nullum eſt malnus in mundo</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bradwardine</hi>) <hi>quod non eſt propter aliquod magnum bonum, &amp; forſitan propter ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod majus bonum;</hi> There is no evil in the world which is not for ſome great good, and perhaps for ſome greater good. <hi>Adam</hi> by his fall broke in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a beautiful image of Holineſs, and the duſt of it made a glaſs of Creature-defectibility. The ſtock of Grace laid up in <hi>Adam,</hi> was loſt; and an unloſeable Treaſury is laid up in Chriſts human nature. <hi>Joſeph's</hi> brethren ſell him, but God ſent him into <hi>Egypt</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.5. Perſecutors ſcatter the Church, and by this means God ſcatters the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.4. Thus he orders the very ſins of men to excellent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
               <p>There being, as hath been ſaid, ſuch a double Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60626:105"/>it is moſt apparent, that both theſe Orders are from his Providence who is the God of order: The Order of Penalty is from him who is Juſtice it ſelf; The Order of Conducibility is from him who is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it ſelf. Providence is either juſtly puniſhing, or wiſely diſpoſing of things. The ſins of men are evil in themſelves, but the Order hath a goodneſs and beauty in it.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being laid down in general, I come now to anſwer this Objection in that inſtance which is above all other, The Sufferings of our Saviour. The blackeſt iniquity that ever the Sun ſaw, was the crucifying of him who was God manifeſted in the fleſh; and yet here Providence did not ſtand off, or at a diſtance, but ordered his ſufferings to bring forth the great work of Redemption. On mans part there was malice, blood, and unparallel'd wickedneſs; yet on Gods there was juſtice, righteouſneſs, and a deſign of incomparable love to ſave the world: Hence it is ſaid, That <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the Gentiles, and the people of <hi>Iſrael, were gathered together to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Gods hand and Gods counſel determined before to be done,</hi> Acts 4.27, 28. Never was there ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a ſin, never ſo ſignal a Providence as here. Some Divines do here diſtinguiſh thus: The paſſion of Chriſt was decreed, but the crucifiers action was not. Others will not admit this diſtinction. <hi>Beza</hi> againſt <hi>Caſtellio</hi> ſays, That common ſenſe is againſt it. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier</hi> thinks that natural light is againſt it. I confeſs that I cannot ſatisfie my ſelf with it. Are the Action and Paſſion really diſtinct? May the one be without the other? May Providence be, as becomes it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if it determine an Effect without a Cauſe; or that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60626:106"/>Chriſt ſhould be ſlain, and not by whom? A ſcheme of one Decree hath been let down from Heaven to us, whoſe accuracy is conſiderable, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. there God did not only decree that <hi>Ahab</hi> ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to go up and fall at <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> but that it ſhould be done by the hardeſt <hi>medium,</hi> by a Lying-ſpirit commiſſionated to go and prevail. And may we think Providence more accurate touching a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on one wicked man, than it is touching the Redemption of the World by Chriſt? and yet will it not be more accurate, if in the one the mode and perſon by whom the thing ſhould be done, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and not in the other? Suppoſe the Action and Paſſion to be diſtinct, yet is not the Paſſion a dependent on the Action? And if the Action be caſual, muſt not the Paſſion be ſo too? And if the Paſſion only be decreed, muſt not the Action be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual? That Action which is altogether undecreed (I mean, there being no Decree of permiſſion upon which the Action as a conſequent doth enſue) is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined by God; and (becauſe there is no mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Determinator) that which is undetermined by God, muſt remain undetermined, till man determines it, that is, till it be done, or at leaſt <hi>in fieri;</hi> and that which is undetermined till then, is caſual to the very moment of its exiſtence; that is, as caſual as any thing can be. And if the Action be caſual, the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is a pendent upon it, muſt be ſo too; and if the Paſſion be caſual, it muſt be undetermined and undecreed as well as the Action; and ſo Providence, while denied in the one, is ſubverted in both. But to ſay no more to that diſtinction, we ſee clearly in the Sufferings of Chriſt, how admirable Providence
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60626:106"/>is, in and about the very ſins of men. There God was wiſe while man was fooliſh; God merciful while man cruel; God juſt while man unrighteous; the light was Gods, and the darkneſs mans; the order Gods, and the ataxy mans; the throne and ſoveraign domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Gods, the ſin and rebellion mans. Wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were turned about to juſt ends, vile actions were over-ruled to excellent purpoſes; at that very death of Chriſt, in which ſo many impious hands thruſt themſelves, Providence was not abſent, but put in its holy hand and counſel to bring forth the glorious work of Redemption and Salvation out of it.</p>
               <p>One thing more may be noted; we have a pregnant proof of Providence in the pious poſture of our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Saviour. When he was under the unjuſt and bloody hands of men, he looked above and beyond them to the hand and Providence of God; when <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> told him, <hi>That he had power to crucifie him,</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>That Pilate could have no power at all againſt him, except it were given him from above,</hi> Joh. 19.11. As much as to ſay, Unleſs it had been Gods determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate counſel, a thouſand <hi>Pilates</hi> could have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. When the <hi>Jews</hi> poured out horrid blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies and injuries, he was as a meek Lamb, dumb, he opened not his mouth. Indeed there were tears and ſtrong-crys to God, but no murmurs or complaint; of men; he looked above them to the pleaſure of his Father: <hi>When he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but committed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.23. O rare Mirrour of Faith and Patience! He knew whom he had to do withal, his eyes were not upon men, but God; not upon their wicked projects, but upon his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60626:107"/>Fathers wiſe counſel. In all his ſufferings he fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced in his Fathers pleaſure, ſaying, <hi>Not my will, but thine be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, we may obſerve, That the Saints have ever owned a Providence watching over the injuries of men. <hi>God ſent me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Joſeph: The Lord hath taken away,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job: The Lord bid him curſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>David: Thou haſt ordained them for judgment,</hi> ſaith <hi>Habakkuk</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees.</hi> Still they look up to the hand of Providence in ſuch events, exerciſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in holy fear, faith, patience, prayer towards God. Were there not a Providence, what ſhould the Saints do? which way could they turn themſelves for comfort? in a ſtorm of Perſecution what doth their fear do? it terminates not on man but God, and that upon very good reaſon; becauſe man is but, as <hi>Attila</hi> called himſelf, <hi>Flagellum Dei,</hi> the ſtaff or rod in the hand of God the great Moderator: but if there be no ſuch thing as Providence, the ſtaff is no longer in Gods hand, but in mans; he may do what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Hence in ſuch a caſe it looks like a piece of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Idolatry to fear man who determines the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; and like a piece of reaſonleſs piety to fear God, who doth juſt nothing at all: and what doth their faith do? they fly under the Almighty ſhadow, and fix their faith as a rare engine, upon that ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Providence, which runs towards them in a more than ordinary ſweetneſs through the Covenant of Grace: in this poſture they ſtand as ſecure, as if by Divine art they could remove the troublous Earth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a quieter <hi>ubi,</hi> or at leaſt be untroubled in the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of it. But if there be no Providence, what can they do? their ſhadow is departed, their faith which
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60626:107"/>may not take ſo low a center as earth or man, hath no Providence or place in Heaven to faſten it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it being irrational to ſtay on the mercy or power of him who doth juſt nothing in ſuch events; Faith now is no more it ſelf but a dream or fancy about ſome Providence or inviſible hand which is not: and what ſhall their patience do? in ſuch caſes they uſe to lay themſelves down at Gods feet, as Lambs not opening their mouths; or elſe ſpeaking low, and as it were out of the duſt of creature-vileneſs, in ſome ſuch ſubmiſſive terms as thoſe of <hi>Ely, It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good;</hi> an excellent poſture for a creature under the great Governour! But if he govern not, patience is no more it ſelf; neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der man, a meer fellow-creature, ſhould it be in ſo low a poſture: it is a Grace which can live no-where but under Providence. The taking away of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ruins patience in the very foundation, no leſs than the taking away of precepts doth obedience. And what can their prayer do? it can unlock Heaven, and by importuning the Governour of the World do great things: but if God rule not, it is but a meer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant thing; no tolerable account can be given, why in ſuch caſes they ſhould addreſs themſelves to him who is no Moderator. Thus we ſee that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Providence is of great moment to the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Saints. I ſhall conclude all with the pious words of two Emperours; the one is <hi>Mauritius,</hi> who ſeeing his Wife and Children murder'd, ſaid, <hi>Juſtus es, Domine, juſta judicia tua.</hi> The other is <hi>Maximili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who in the time of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his thoughts touching Providence thus, <hi>Deus aeterne! niſi vigilares, quàm malè eſſet mundo, quom
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60626:108"/>regimus nos? ego miſer venator, &amp; ebrioſus ille ac ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leratus Julius?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There being a Divine Providence, ſuch as ſpreads it ſelf over all things, what acknowledgments and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorations ſhould be paid to it? it upholds and directs all things, it ſtoops down to worms and hairs; it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the great things of the Church and the World; it aſcertains the moſt caſual events; it rules over the freeſt agents; nay, it reduces ſin it ſelf, the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible of ataxies into order; it brings light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, order out of confuſion, good out of evil; it leaves <hi>nihil inordinatum in univerſo,</hi> nothing ſimply totally inordinate in all the World. O how ſhould we hang and depend upon it! our purpoſes ſhould all have that pious condition, <hi>If the Lord will, we will do this or that,</hi> Jam. 4.15. Our motto ſhould be, <hi>nihil ſine Deo,</hi> nothing without Providence. In all our ways we ſhould look up and wait for the good hand of God to direct and proſper us, without which vanity takes us, and all comes to nothing. In our converſes with men we ſhould look above them to him who ſits at the ſtern and rules: Do they do us good? let us remember the fountain is above, man is but the channel; not the leaſt good drops from them, but what was diſtilled out of them by Providence. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he ſaw Eſaus face as the face of God,</hi> Gen 33.10. Little of God was to be found in <hi>Eſau,</hi> yet in his kindneſs <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpied out a beam of the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and favour. Do they deal ill with us? let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider no more of their malice or wrath can iſſue forth upon us than Providence will ſuffer, the remainder ſhall be reſtrained and kept: back in their verbal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and obloquies let us ſay with <hi>David,</hi> the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60626:108"/>Lord hath bid him curſe. In their real injuries and oppreſſions, let us ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> the <hi>Lord hath taken away;</hi> ſtill our eyes ſhould be lifted up above inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to that wiſe Providence which orders all. In all the great affairs of the Church and the World let us ſtill hold to this, <hi>the Lord reigneth,</hi> Pſal. 93.1. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence governs the World, and all in it: hereſies and bloody perſecutions may break out as a flood, yet Truth ſhall ſtand, and the Church built upon it. In a word, ſeeing God is univerſal Governour, we ſhould fear him in every place, eye him in every work, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him in every event, depend upon him in every eſtate, and glorifie him in all his adminiſtrations. This is indeed to confeſs his Kingdom which ruleth over all, and practically to own his Providence, which ſweetly and ſtrongly diſpoſes all things to his own Praiſe and Glory.</p>

               <p>IN the next place I ſhall proceed to conſider Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, the Doctrine of which is very momentous. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in the fourteenth <hi>Pſalm</hi> notably ſets forth the corrupt eſtate of man by nature; and again, he ſets it forth in the 53. <hi>Pſal.</hi> almoſt in the ſame words, pointing out to us the great neceſſity and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of this Doctrine,<note place="margin">Moll.

This is a moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary fundamental Doctrine.<note place="margin">De peccat. Or. lib. 2. cap. 24.</note> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>In horum duorum hominum cauſa proprie fides Chriſtiana conſiſtit:</hi> the Chriſtian faith ſtands in the knowledg of thoſe two men; the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60626:109"/>one the ſpring of ſin and death; the other the ſpring of grace and life. And ſpeaking of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> as denying Original ſin, he charges them,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 90, &amp; 94.</note>

                  </gap>, know thy ſelf, becomes altogether unpracticable; a man though near to his own ſoul, is a ſtranger to it; though he hath a reflecting faculty, yet he cannot make a true inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into his heart he ſees only his outſide: within there is a deadly wound, yet he feels it not; a ſink, a chaos of corruptions, yet he perceives it not: that holy image which was the beauty and pure rectitude of his nature, is departed and gone; yet he is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at it. He is, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>totus lapſus,</hi> all fallen, all out of order; yet it ſeems to him as if all were well and in a due poſture: he is miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked, and yet inſenſible in all theſe, according to that falſe or rather no-judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he hath of himſelf: he is happy in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, rich in his poverty, ſeeing in his blindneſs, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in his ſhame and ſpiritual nakedneſs; in the midſt of ſtraits and neceſſities he finds no need of Chriſt, or regenerating grace: the neceſſity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of theſe appears in ſuch proportion as the depth and breadth of that ſin is apprehended to be. Hence it is obſervable on the one hand, Thoſe who own <hi>Adam</hi> to be a fountain of ſin and death, do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al own Chriſt to be a fountain of righteouſneſs and life. Thoſe who ſee the horrible ataxy and pravity in our nature, ſee alſo the neceſſity and excellency of Grace in the repairing of it. On the other hand the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> who deny Original ſin, are
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60626:110"/>enemies to Grace; it is in the power and will of man; <hi>vel nitere flore virtutum, vel ſentibus horrere vitiorum;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auſt. de Grat. Chriſt. c. 18.</note> to make himſelf beautiful with the flowers of virtue, or horrid with the brambles of vice. So <hi>Pelagius. In noſtra poteſtate ſitum eſt, ut Deo obtemperemus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 10.</note> it is in our power to obey God. So the <hi>Racovian</hi> Catechiſt. And what room is there for Grace,<note place="margin">Auſt. ad Boniſ. lib. 1. cap. 21.</note> when the power and free-will of man may do the work? The <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> affirmed, that before the Law men were ſaved by Nature, afterwards by the Law,<note place="margin">Socin. de Serv. pars 3. cap. 2.</note> afterwards by Chriſt. The <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay, that under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment good men were ſaved without any reſpect to Chriſt or faith in him, and what need then was there of Chriſt, or his ſatisfactory ſufferings for us? the great work might be done without him. Hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that to deny Original ſin is to caſt off Chriſt and Grace. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbins, who made the evil fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in mans heart to be but a light matter, ſmall as a thread, weak as a woman, ruleable by the good fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our own reaſon, were very ignorant of that great point of Regeneration. Hence <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſtartled and ſtood at a maze at our Saviours Doctrine about it, <hi>How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the ſecond time into his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb and be born?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. Such car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and groſs expoſtulations could never have dropt from him if he had had a true ſenſe of Original ſin, but for want of that Regeneration was a ſtrange and unintelligible myſtery to him. The Pagan Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers had ſome glimmerings of Original ſin; hence they complained that the ſoul had loſt her wings, and crept upon theſe lower things; that it was in the body as a priſon, and there lookt out at the grates of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60626:110"/>ſenſe; that it was fallen from the happy Region, and inclined to evil. But, becauſe theſe were but glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings, they did not ſo much as dream of Grace or Regeneration; becauſe they did not ſee the depth and venom of our Original wound, they thought there was <hi>medicamentum in latere,</hi> enough in the Power and Free-will of the ſoul to heal it ſelf: they reckoned all virtues to be among the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the things in our power; and accounted the will to be ſuch a miſtreſs of it ſelf, that it might make it ſelf good and excellent at its pleaſure. By all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances we ſee plainly, that the Doctrine of Original ſin is very uſeful and momentous.</p>
               <p>Original ſin is ſet forth by many names in Scripture. It is called Sin, The ſinning ſin, The ſin that dwelleth in us, The ſin that doth eaſily beſet us, The Law of ſin and death, The Law in the Members, The fleſh and the old man, The root of bitterneſs, The plague of the heart: in the Fathers it is called the paternal poyſon, The firſt radical ſin, The venom and ſtroke of the old ſerpent, The contagion of the ancient death, The weight of the ancient crime, The inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Original. And St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that he might aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain that in which he oppoſed the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> called it Original ſin, from whence that name was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards frequent in the Church: it was ſo called, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe we have it in our Original; it is interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with our nature, and may ſay to every one of us, As ſoon as thou wert, I am; partly becauſe it is derived to us from <hi>Adam,</hi> the head and original of mankind.<note n="*" place="margin">Non peccat iſte qui naſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, non pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat ille qui genuit, non peccat iſte qui condidit, per quas rima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Per unum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem, ait Apoſtolus, quid quaerit amplius?</note> do you feign that ſin did enter? St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> anſwers him thus: Why doth he ſeek a chink or a crany, when he hath an open gate? <hi>By one man,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, what would he have more? It is that one man <hi>Adam,</hi> the original of mankind, by whom ſin entred into the world; it is by him that it is derived to us. That one Text, touching the one man, is enough to break and ſweep away all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile cobwebs which the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> have ſpun out of their Wit and carnal Reaſon to oppoſe the Doctrine of Original ſin.</p>
               <p>Original ſin conſiſts in two things:
<list>
                     <item>1. In that <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin is imputatively ours.</item>
                     <item>2. In that we have an inordination and inherent pravity derived upon us from him.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt thing is, <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin imputatively ours: not that God reputes us to have done it in our own perſon; not that it is imputed to us in the full latitude, as it was to <hi>Adam.</hi> We ſinned not as the head and root of mankind, we murdered not the whole humane nature; we did not uſher in ſin and death upon the world: no, as the Apoſtle ſaith, this was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by one <hi>Adam;</hi> but as ſoon as any man becomes <hi>proles Adae,</hi> in conjunction with him, it is imputed to him, <hi>pro menſura membri,</hi> in ſuch ſort and proportion as is competent to him, being a part and piece as it were of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12. Queſt. 81. Art. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Aquinas</hi> illuſtrates this by a notable inſtance: Murder as a ſin is not imputable to the hand in it ſelf, as diſtinct or ſeparate from the body; but as it is a Member in man, and moved by his Will: in like manner the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is imputed to us, not ſo properly as we are in our ſelves, but as
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60626:111"/>we are parts and pieces of him, and derived our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from him. <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was paſt before we were born. It is therefore, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> well expreſſes it,<note place="margin">Nobis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatur co modo, quo communicari poteſt id quod tranſiit, nimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum per im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putationem, <hi>De Amiſſ.

It is therefore impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us in that meaſure, as is fit and juſt for it to be imputed to thoſe who are parts and members of <hi>Adam.</hi> In that capacity it is conſtructively and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively ours, and accordingly God juſtly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons and imputes it unto us. That this is ſo, I ſhall offer ſome Conſiderations;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That of the Apoſtle is very pregnant; <hi>by one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5.12. In the Original it is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in him, that is, in <hi>Adam</hi> all have ſinned. Thoſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are Relative. Three things, as St.<note place="margin">Cont. 2. Epiſt. <hi>Ptl.</hi> l. 4. c. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, are ſet down in this verſe before; <hi>Adam,</hi> Sin, and Death: thoſe words relate not to ſin, for Sin in the Greek is a Feminine; nor to death, for men do not ſin in death, but dye in ſin; therefore they relate to <hi>Adam, in him all have ſinned.</hi> It's true, others take the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> cauſally, for that all have ſinned. But I think that, as I ſaid before, they are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Relatively, <hi>in him all have ſinned.</hi> Thus thoſe three things, which the Apoſtle conjoyned together in this verſe, that is, the propagation of ſin, the original of death, and the foundation of both, very well cohere together in this manner. The firſt we have in thoſe words, <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world.</hi> The ſecond in thoſe, <hi>Death paſſed upon all.</hi> The third in thoſe, <hi>In him all have ſinned.</hi> Thus
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60626:112"/>thoſe phraſes, <hi>ſin entred, death paſſed,</hi> have a plain explication. Sin did not ſtay in <hi>Adam,</hi> but it entred into the world: But if <hi>Adams</hi> ſin be not imputative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ours, how did it enter? It entred by Imitation, ſay the <hi>Pelagians:</hi> but how vain is this? Sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon all, upon whom death paſſed, and death paſſed upon all without exception. But neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, who ſin not actually, or after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion; nor thoſe adult perſons, who ſin actually, but never ſo much as heard of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, could have ſin from <hi>Adam</hi> by Imitation. We are all ſinners, and children of wrath, not by Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by nature; <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was not meerly his own, but ours by Imitation. Thus ſin entred into the world, and as a penal fruit of it, death paſſed upon all; it did not ſtay at <hi>Adam,</hi> but paſſed upon all: and if <hi>Adams</hi> ſin became not ours, how ſhould that be? The Apoſtle doth not barely ſet down ſin and death, but ſets them down in their order and connexion. Firſt ſin entred, and then death paſſed, and that not as a meer infelicity or miſery, but as a juſt puniſhment for ſin. Hence it is obſervable, that the Text ſaith, <hi>That death came by ſin, and ſo paſſed upon all.</hi> The Particles (<hi>by</hi> and <hi>fo</hi>) ſhew that death paſſed upon all as a puniſhment. If <hi>Adams</hi> ſin were not all mens, how could death paſs upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, who have no actual ſin? God is not, cannot be unjuſt; where there is no fault, there is no room for puniſhment; if infants in no ſenſe tranſgreſſed the Command in <hi>Adam,</hi> the death in the threatning can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall upon them,<note place="margin">De Incar. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Quâ juſtitiâ parvulus ſubjicitur peccati ſtipendio, ſi nulla eſt in eo peccati pollutio?</hi> ſaith <hi>Fulgentius;</hi> With what juſtice can an infant be
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60626:112"/>ſubject to the wages of ſin, if the pollution of it be not in him? May there be <hi>poena ſine cauſa,</hi> a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without a <hi>why</hi> or a <hi>wherefore?</hi> It cannot be. If therefore, even Infants in <hi>Adam</hi> died, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22, then in <hi>Adam</hi> all ſinned, as he tells us in the frequented Text. That this is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine meaning of it, doth not only appear by the Text it ſelf, but by that which followeth: <hi>By one mans diſobedience many were conſtituted ſinners,</hi> v. 19. No. unimputed ſin can do this. If therefore <hi>Adams</hi> ſin conſtitute us ſinners, it is imputed to us. To ſay, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> and ſome others do, to conſtitute us ſinners, is only to make us obnoxious to death, and ſo to be treated as ſinners, is a thing vain and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Text. To be treated as a ſinner, is not to be conſtituted ſuch. To be treated as a ſinner, when a man is not ſuch, is very unjuſt and unequal. To be a ſinner, is to be culpable or guilty of a fault; and the proper ſignification muſt be retained. The Apoſtle in this Chapter evidently diſtinguiſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſin and death, tranſgreſſion and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and makes <hi>Adam</hi> the origine of both, firſt of ſin; and then, by ſin, of death: Therefore <hi>Adam</hi> firſt makes us ſinners, and then obnoxious to death. Thus the words being taken relatively, <hi>In him all have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> the concluſion is plain, That <hi>Adams</hi> ſin is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us. Nay, if the words be taken cauſally, <hi>for that all have ſinned,</hi> the concluſion is the very ſame; If <hi>death paſſed upon all men, becauſe all have ſinned,</hi> then Infants, becauſe death paſſes upon them, have ſinned: And how have they ſinned? Not in their own perſons, they are not capable of ſinning actually; but in <hi>Adam,</hi> the root of mankind: Not
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60626:113"/>by an Imitation, they are not capable of ſuch a thing; but by a participation of the firſt ſin, which by a juſt Imputation becomes theirs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The capacity which <hi>Adam</hi> was in, is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. He was not conſidered as a meer individual perſon, but as the Principle and Origine of Human nature. The admirable endowments of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and immortality, were truſted and depoſited in his hands, not meerly for himſelf, but for his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The command was not given to him as to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular perſon, but as the Root and Head of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The Covenant made with him, run thus: If he did (as he was able) obey the command, he ſhould transfer innocency and life to his poſterity; If not, he ſhould transfer ſin and death to it. We were in him naturally, as latent in his Joins; and legally, as comprized within the Covenant. This is very clear, becauſe the death in the threatning annexed to the command given to him, falls upon his poſterity. Had not the command extended to his children, the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning could not have reached them. Had not they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Adam</hi> their Head and Root, death could not have faln upon them in ſuch ſort as it doth; that is, in a ſtate of infancy, void of any actual ſin of its own. This being the true ſtate of things, it is no wonder at all that <hi>Adams</hi> ſin ſhould be imputed to us as parts and pieces of him. <hi>Adam</hi> was here conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the Root and Origine of mankind: his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was the fountain of ours; his Will the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of ours. <hi>Omnes nos unus ille Adam;</hi> We were one with him, and branches of him. Hence we ſinned in his ſin, and putrified in him as in the root. Theſe things, if weighed, give an eaſie ſolution to all the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60626:113"/>cavils and objections which the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and their followers make againſt the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin to us. Firſt, They ſay, <hi>Deus, qui propria peccata re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit, non imputat aliena:</hi> God, who forgives us our own ſins, doth not impute to us another mans. But here is a great miſtake, as if <hi>Adams</hi> ſin were juſt nothing at all to us. <hi>Adam</hi> was the Root, and bore all mankind in himſelf; we were ſeminally and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally in him: His ſin therefore was not alien altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to us, but in a ſort our own. We ſinned in him as our Head: We fell with him as the branches fall with the body of the Tree. St. <hi>Austin</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Contr. <hi>Jul.</hi> l. 6: cap. 4.</note> Though <hi>Adams</hi> ſin were alien <hi>proprietate actionis;</hi> yet it was ours <hi>contagione propaginis.

                  <hi>Bernard</hi> notably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, <hi>Culpa aliena eſt, quia in</hi> Adam <hi>omnes neſcientes peccavimus, noſtra, quia etſi in alio nos tamen peccavimus, &amp; nobis juſto Dei judicio imputabatur, licet occulto: Adams</hi> ſin was alien to us, becauſe we ignorantly ſinned in him; yet it was ours, becauſe we ſinned, though in another; and it was to us imputed by the juſt, though ſecret counſel of God. Again they ſay, That which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſin in us, is voluntary, and an act of our will; but <hi>Adams</hi> was not ſuch. I anſwer: The foundation of this Objection, That all proper ſin is voluntary, or an act of our will, is not univerſally true: Vain thoughts are ſin, and ſuch as are the objects of a good mans hatred, much more of the hatred of the Holy One; yet they are no acts of our will. The firſt riſings and ſtirrings of luſt, which antecede conſent, are ſins, and yet no acts of our will. The mutinies and rebellions of the lower faculties againſt Reaſon, are ſins, and yet
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60626:114"/>no acts of our will. But might this rule hold in actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſin, yet ſurely it cannot in original; for then there ſhould be no ſuch thing as original ſin, though Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Fathers, Councils, aſſert it; though the Church have been poſſeſſed of this truth in all ages; yet it is an error, there is really no ſuch thing: For neither was <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion the act of our will, neither is the inherent pravity in us ſuch. If then we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs original ſin, we muſt acknowledg that the rule ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to it. Thus when <hi>Julian</hi> objects, That there is no ſin in Infants, becauſe they have not the exerciſe of free-will; St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> diſtinguiſhes thus: <hi>Hoc recte dicitur propter proprium cujuſ<expan>

                  <hi>peccatum, non propter primi peccati originale contagium;</hi> Whatever may be ſaid in actual ſin, it is not ſo in original. Further, <hi>Adams</hi> ſin as to us, may be ſaid to be voluntary, in two reſpects; the one is this: It was voluntary, <hi>voluntate pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi parentis,</hi> in the will of <hi>Adam</hi> the Head of Mankind, while he ſtood in his integrity. He was the moral Head of Mankind, and, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Totius humani generis geſſit perſonam,</hi> he ſuſtained the perſon of all mankind; his will therefore was interpretatively ours; our will was virtually in his. Murder is imputed to the hand, becauſe the will, though it be not there, is yet in that perſon of whom the hand is a part. In like manner <hi>Adams</hi> ſin is imputed to us, becauſe the will, though it was not perſonally in us, was yet in him, of whom we are parts and members. Thus that learned Profeſſor Dr.<note place="margin">De Peccat. Or. 107.</note> 
                  <hi>Ward, Ex voluntate primi pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentis, ex quo tota poſteritas derivatur, peccatum illud in poſteris, velut in membris Adae, voluntarium eſſe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetur;</hi> The will of the firſt Parent, from whom all the poſterity is derived, renders his ſin voluntary in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60626:114"/>all men, as being members of him. The other reſpect is this, it is voluntary in us, in our own perſons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually; there is in us an evil frame and diſpoſition to ſin and tranſgreſs as <hi>Adam</hi> did; the act was his, yet a ſeed of it is found in us. Further, they ſay, It is againſt juſtice and equity, that <hi>Adams</hi> ſin ſhould be imputed to us; that we, innocent in our ſelves, ſhould be guilty by a ſin not our own. I anſwer, <hi>Adams</hi> capacity conſidered, there is no injuſtice in it; he was the head and root of mankind, he was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Truſtee of righteouſneſs and immortality for all; the Covenant was made with him for himſlf and for his poſterity; his ſin therefore was not meerly his, but ours; neither are we born innocent, but guilty: If it were againſt juſtice and equity to impute his ſin to us, then it was againſt juſtice and equity to puniſh us for it with death temporal, ſpiritual, eternal: But the latter is falſe; ſo therefore is the former. Death falls as a puniſhment upon Infants void of actual ſin of their own: Thus the Apoſtle lays it down clearly, <hi>Sin entered into the world, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men, Rom.</hi> 5.12. Death was not a meer miſery or infelicity, but a juſt puniſhment. Surely it conſiſts not with juſtice and equity, that proper puniſhment ſhould fall on perſons altogether void of guilt; or that the threatning of death ſhould ſeize upon thoſe who no way tranſgreſſed that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to which it was annexed; therefore the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin to us, is ſo far from being againſt juſtice and equity, that without it, the equity and juſtice of God in inflicting death as a puniſhment upon all men, cannot be reaſonably cleared. I need add but one thing more, God dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60626:115"/>head of mankind, upon terms of abundant equity: for as <hi>Adam</hi> ſinning, was to transfer ſin and death to us; ſo <hi>Adam</hi> obeying, was to transfer righteouſneſs and immortality to us: The terms were equal on both hands; we were in him as our head, as well for the obtaining of bleſſedneſs upon his obedience, as for the incurring puniſhment upon his diſobedience. Theſe objections being removed out of the way, I conclude, That the capacity which <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in at firſt, is a clear evidence, that his ſin is imputed to us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If <hi>Adams</hi> ſin be not imputed to us, then neither was his righteouſneſs ſo; then we never were righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, we never were eſteemed ſuch in Gods account; then we are not fallen creatures, we are meerly ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as God made us: Then what need of renovation or regeneration? An unfallen creature is uncapable of reparation; Whence then, or by what way could it poſſibly come to paſs, that there ſhould be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate inordination or proneneſs to evil in us? Such things cannot be found in an unfallen rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet doubtleſs they are found in us. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, that we are naturally dark; nay, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf: <hi>That the heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked.</hi> Nay, the very Philoſophers ſpied out this. Hence <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith, That man was brought forth into life, not by nature as a Mother, but as a Step-mother; with a body naked, frail, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, with a mind anxious in troubles, low in fears, ſoft in labours, prone to luſts. Upon which St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> gloſſes thus,<note place="margin">Contr. <hi>Jul.</hi> l. 4. cap. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Naturam accuſavit, rem vidit, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam neſcivit, latebat eum cur eſſet grave jugum ſuper fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lios Adam.</hi> He accuſed nature, the thing he ſaw, the

                     <hi>Volk.</hi> de Rel. l. 1. c. 6.</note> Men are by nature prone to ſin: Nay, it is added, ſenſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite draw them, as it were, with chains to vice. Thus ſaith one of them, Whence then is this natural inordination and pravity? Is it from the fall? We are not fallen creatures. Is it from the Creator? It is impoſſible. Darkneſs cannot be from the Father of lights, nor pravity from the fountain of infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Adams</hi> ſin not being imputed to us, no tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble account can be given, how it ſhould ever come to exiſt among men. But ſuppoſing what is moſt true, That it is naturally in us; yet, unleſs <hi>Adams</hi> ſin be imputatively ours, it is not ſin in us: What though we want knowledg and righteouſneſs? It is not <hi>Caren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia juſtitiae debitae ineſſe,</hi> a want of what ought to be in us; it is not a privative want, a want of what we once had in <hi>Adams</hi> righteouſneſs, and afterwards loſt in his ſin; but it is a meer negative want, a want of that we never had, nor never forfeited. <hi>Adams</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs being not imputed to us, we never had it; <hi>Adams</hi> ſin being not imputed to us, we never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited it; ſuch a meer negative want, is no ſin. What though there be a pravity and propenſity to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſin in us? It is no ſin in unfallen creatures, it is no ſin to be made or created, it is no ſin to be born or brought forth; it is no ſin, if there be no cauſe or foundation of it in us; and there can be no cauſe or foundation of it in us, if we no way participate of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; it may be called miſery, but it is no
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60626:116"/>ſin: Hence that ſaying of St. <hi>Auſtin, Nulla foret ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis culpa, ſi talis a Deo creatus eſſet, qualis nunc na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcitur;</hi> There would be no fault in man, if he were created ſuch by God, as he is now born; the pure primordials of nature cannot be culpable. That man, who is meerly what his Creator made him, is as he ought to be. The reſult of all is this: <hi>Adams</hi> ſin not being imputed to us, there can be no ſuch thing as original ſin; though this Doctrine hath been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Church in all ages; yet there is no ſuch thing, neither is <hi>Adams</hi> ſin imputatively ours; nor yet is the natural pravity in us any ſin. If therefore we will acknowledg original ſin, we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that <hi>Adams</hi> ſin is ours by a juſt Imputation. Thus much touching the firſt original thing in ſin: <hi>Adams</hi> ſin is imputatively ours.</p>
               <p>The other is this, We have an inordination, and inherent pravity in us; this depends upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. All habitual ſin, hath an eſſential relation to ſome actual ſin precedent; no man can can be a ſinner habitually, who is totally free from actual ſin. If we had not in ſome ſenſe ſinned in <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, we could not have been habitually vitiated by it. At firſt man was an excellent creature, ſparkling with a divine image of knowledg and righteouſneſs; all was in harmony, the rational powers of the Soul were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to God their Creator; the ſenſitive powers were ſubject to the rational; in every part there was a juſt decorum: But upon the fall, which was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively ours, the Crown fell from our head, the Glory of the Divine Image departed, the Soul became naked, the very ſhame of the body told it, that the primitive rectitude was wanting; darkneſs fell upon
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60626:116"/>the Mind, the once region of light; bondage and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency fell upon the Will, the once ſeat of power and liberty; all was out of frame: The rational powers turned rebels to God; the ſenſitive were all in a mutiny againſt the rational. There was in us a pravity, an horrible propenſity to all manner of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; a <hi>Belial</hi>-heart, ſuch as is <hi>evil, and only evil, and that continually.</hi> This pravity runs parallel with our being and humanity; it overſpreads the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of our nature, and ſo adheres to it, that even in the Saints it is not utterly extinct till the laſt breath; nor totally cleanſed away, till the Clay-walls of the body fall into the grave. This is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the conceiving-luſt; the womb where all iniquity is formed. This is the Grave or <hi>Sheol</hi> in man, which in its unreaſonable deſires never hath enough. This is that Concupiſcence, which, as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſay, doth <hi>aedificare inferos,</hi> make and build an Hell for men. Now that there is ſuch an inordination and inherent pravity in us, doth eaſily appear by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture doth abundantly teſtifie it. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam begat a ſon in his own likeneſs</hi> (after his image), <hi>and called his name Seth,</hi> Gen. 5.3. <hi>Adam</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the likeneſs of God, <hi>v.</hi> 1; but after his fall he begat a ſon in his own likeneſs. When God created man in his likeneſs, it was <hi>ſanctus ſanctum,</hi> an Holy God created an holy man: But when <hi>Adam</hi> begat a ſon in his likeneſs, it was <hi>corruptus corruptum,</hi> polluted <hi>Adam</hi> begat a polluted ſon: and in the Text there are two words (<hi>likeneſs</hi> and <hi>image</hi>) to ſet the greater brand upon corrupt nature. It is remarkable, that the Text doth not here ſpeak of <hi>Abel,</hi> who dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60626:117"/>iſſue; nor of <hi>Cain,</hi> all whoſe progeny was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the flood; but of <hi>Seth,</hi> by whom all mankind hath hitherto been continued in the world: which ſhews that none are exempted from it. <hi>God ſaw that every imagination of the thoughts of mans heart, was only evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6.5: and afterwards God ſaith, that it was ſo from his youth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the original it is, Every formation or fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the heart; all that was framed or effigiated there, is only evil, and that from his youth: Where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word uſed, reaches in other Scriptures e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to infancy. Which ſhews, that we are tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors from the womb. Hence one of the <hi>Jewiſh Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi> being asked when the evil imagination was put into man? anſwered, From the hour that he is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Hence that ancient ſaying, <hi>Ipſe ortus in vitio eſt;</hi> Our firſt riſe is iniquity. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking of mans birth, ſaith, <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one,</hi> Job 14.4. Man; who is of unclean Parents, muſt needs be unclean. Nothing but ſupernatural grace can purifie ſuch an one; none but the Holy One can make us clean. <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me;</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is, <hi>warm me. Pſal.</hi> 51.5, He confeſſes that there was iniquity even in <hi>primo ardore,</hi> in the firſt warmth of natural conception: before he was born or ſaw the light, he was polluted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean. <hi>Antequam naſcimur,</hi>

Our Saviour ſpeaking of Regeneration, ſaith, <hi>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh,</hi> Joh. 3.6. In natural gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration there is nothing but fleſh or corrupt nature; the Spirit or Divine nature is from Regeneration
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60626:117"/>only. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiles this inward pravity, a <hi>body of ſin, Rom.</hi> 6.6. It is a loathſome carkaſs made up of vile matter. It is not ſo much one ſin, as virtually all; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins are parts and branches of it. The weight and preſſure of this body made even St. <hi>Paul</hi> cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death!</hi> Rom. 7.24. Thus, and much more, doth the Scripture bear witneſs to this truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No man, who ſeriouſly looks into the frame of his own heart, can want a proof of this truth. Upon a faithful inſpection into himſelf, a ſink of ſin, a Chaos of turpitudes and horrible irregularities will appear to be in him. Reaſon was lighted up by God; but it is now as a beam prodigiouſly cut off from the fountain of light. Leaving the firſt Truth, it wanders and loſes it ſelf in a wilderneſs of Errors. Forgetting its great Original, it gropes in the dark about the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme End, and cannot of it ſelf find the dore to true happineſs. It doth, and that by a ſingular privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg above other creatures, know its Maker; and yet in an unreaſonable manner it turns away from him, and ſeeks an happineſs in the lower World, or at beſt in it ſelf. It ſhould, like the Celeſtial bodies, move circularly; and after a ſurvey of all creatures, return back to the ſame point from whence it came, which is the boſom of God himſelf; and yet it flies away from him, and makes its neſt in one Creature-vanity or other. It hath a natural and indelible inſtinct af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter happineſs, and perpetually cryes out, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> And yet it is not able ſo much as by a holy thought to aſpire after the great Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſet forth before it in the Goſpel. Heavy things deſcend by a right line to their center: Brutes haſten
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60626:118"/>to thoſe things which are congruous and convenient to their natures: Only Man, though endowed far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove theſe with Reaſon and Liberty, falls ſhort, and miſſes the mark. Pure Precepts, excellent Promiſes, heavenly Myſteries, are ſet before him in the Goſpel, yet without a ſupernatural illumination, he cannot perceive or receive them; at moſt he ſees them only in the image or picture of the Letter, but not in their livelineſs and ſpiritual glory: a form or ſhell of knowledg he may have, but he doth not taſt or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the ſweetneſs of them. And all this becauſe his Reaſon, though active enough in naturals, is in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals but as an eye without an optick faculty, dark, nay darkneſs it ſelf. The Will, though its proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject be good, turns away from God, who is Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf, and ſeeks its chief good ſomewhere elſe. It opens it ſelf in a free choice to every vanity that paſſes by; yet is it ſhut to God and all the offers of grace; forſaking God the Fountain of Liberty, it becomes an arrant Slave and Drudg to ſin; and, which is wonderfully prodigious, it is in love with its chains, and loth to be made free indeed. All the goodneſs in God, Chriſt, Heaven, Bleſſedneſs, outwardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, move it not to ſtir a foot towards ſuch attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects; ſtill it hangs in vanity, and lyes upon the dunghill of the world, and rowls it ſelf in the mire of one luſt or other. It hath an enmity againſt God, who made it free; it would be above his Will who is Supreme: rather than its inordinate luſts ſhould be reſtrained, it would have God ceaſe to be.

                           <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan>, deteriora ſequor.</hi> The Affections, which primitively were ſervants to Reaſon, are now upon the Throne. Reaſon, though once a Royal Prince, is dethroned and become ſervile. That which is the glory of our nature, and proves us to be men, that is hurried up and down by the rude rabble of luſts and malapert paſſions. This being the natural frame and temper of man, let us ſit down and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider; Was it thus from the beginning? Was humane nature ſuch in the firſt impreſſion? Did God put his Reaſon under a Cloud, or his Will into chains and ſervitude? Was it from God, that the one turns away from the firſt truth, and the other from the chief good? Did God put into man an inſtinct after hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in vain, or inſpire into him an immortal ſpirit, that it might creep upon the earth, and pour out it ſelf to every vanity? Did God create man at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with himſelf, and at firſt, ſet up that unnatural inteſtine war, which is between the rational and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive powers? Was it his pleaſure, that the inferior faculties in man ſhould contumaciouſly reluct againſt the ſuperior; or that the ſuperior ſhould baſely ſerve the inferior? Without doubt it cannot be. God is light, purity, Wiſdom it ſelf; theſe things are dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, corruption, ataxy, and cannot be from him. No other account can be given of them but this;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60626:119"/>That they are the bruiſes of the fall, the wounds of corrupt nature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No man, who looks abroad into the World, can with any colour oppoſe this truth. The millions of actual ſins, which as a mighty deluge overſpread the world, are as ſo many pregnant proofes of that original pravity which is in us. In the old world all fleſh had corrupted its way, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.12. Afterwards, all nations walked in their own ways, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16. That is, in ſinful ones: ſin is the courſe of the world, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. It is the element and proper <hi>ubi</hi> of it; the whole world lies in it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. And whence is it, that ſin is ſo univerſal, that iniquity abounds in all times and places? Our Saviour opens the bloody fountain of it, <hi>Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, falſe-witneſs, blaſphemies,</hi> Matt. 15.19. All theſe black troops of wickedneſs, iſſue out from the corrupt heart of man; the inherent pravity which is there, is ſeminally all the monſters of vice. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> proving all under ſin, doth thus deſcribe the corrupt eſtate of men; <hi>There is none righteous, no not one. There is none that underſtandeth, none that ſeeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unprofitable, there is none that doeth good, no not one. Their throat is an open ſepulcher, with their tongues they have uſed deceit, the poiſon of aſps is under their lips: Whoſe mouth is full of curſing and bitterneſs: Their feet are ſwift to ſhed blood: Deſtruction and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery are in their ways: The way of peace have they not known: There is no fear of God before their eyes,</hi> Rom. 3. Here the Apoſtle paints out corrupt nature; not that all men actually do theſe things, but that there is in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60626:119"/>every one, even from their infancy, a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an univerſal ſeminary of iniquity, a venemous root of all actual ſins. In this reſpect, the deſcription apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to all, even to little infants; and the ſcope of the Text requires, that it ſhould be ſo interpreted: for before this deſcription, the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>all are under ſin, verſ.</hi> 9; and after it, that <hi>every mouth is ſtopped,</hi> that <hi>all the world is guilty before God;</hi> that <hi>by the deeds of the law, no fleſh ſhall be juſtified in his ſight, verſ.</hi> 19, 20: and afterwards, that <hi>all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God, verſ.</hi> 23. If the deſcription did not reach all men, his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions drawn from thence would not hold; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription might extend to ſome, yet others, at leaſt little Infants, might not be ſinners or guilty; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently might be juſtified by the Law, as having nothing againſt them. The Apoſtle therefore here, by the actual ſins of ſome, proves original ſin in all; and upon that account proves all to be guilty, under ſin, and unjuſtifiable by the Law; becauſe all have that inherent pravity, which is the root of actual ſins. St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, That <hi>every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own luſt and enticed,</hi> Jam. 1.14. Luſt or original concupiſcence, is the great tempter; it doth not only entice as an object, but by a kind of <hi>impetus</hi> and importunity, it draws us away from God the infinite goodneſs, to one creature-vanity or other; by its motions and titillations it wooes for a conſent, and afterwards it brings forth the outward act of ſin. The world tempts outwardly, but this is <hi>domeſticus hoſtis,</hi> a traitor within in our own boſom; it tempts not objectively only, but effectively, really inclining us to ſin: it is a perpetual tempter, <hi>Reſiſt the Devil
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60626:120"/>and he will fly from you,</hi> Jam. 4.7, but make never ſo great a reſiſtence againſt this luſt, it will not in this life fly from you, neither can you fly from it. This is that which conceives and brings forth all the actual ſins in the world: Nay, it is that which diſtils ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into the beſt actions of Saints; all the crying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations in the world, and all the defects in the Church are the progeny of it. This is the root of all bitterneſs, the <hi>fomes peccati,</hi> the neſt and womb of all actual ſins.</p>
               <p>It may be thought perhaps that all this diſcourſe is beſides the intended ſcope, original ſin was not exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in Chriſt: But I anſwer, It was not indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in him, but the Doctrine of it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably drawn from him. To this end I ſhall offer theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The conception of Chriſt is very conſiderable. He was conceived in the Virgins womb, not in the ordinary way of nature; not by the conjunction of man and woman, but in a Divine and extraordinary manner; in a way above all the power and law of nature. Hence the Angel tells the Virgin <hi>Mary, The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee,</hi> Luk. 1.35. Hence it is ſaid, that <hi>ſhe was found with child of the Holy Ghoſt, Matt.</hi> 1.18. That is, the body of Chriſt was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the infinite power and virtue, though not out of the ſubſtance of the Holy Spirit. The ſubſtance of Chriſts fleſh was taken out of the Virgin, and like unto ours; but the ſtructure and manner of framing of it, was infinitely ſurmounting that of ours. Hence his fleſh is ſaid, <hi>to be a tabernacle not made with hands, not of this building, Heb.</hi> 9.11. It was not ſet up in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60626:120"/>the natural way of generation, but in a miraculous ſupernatural manner; and why was it thus, but that his humane nature might, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks, be an holy thing, pure from the leaſt tincture of ſin? All men, who come from <hi>Adam</hi> in a natural way, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract guilt and pravity in their original; but his fleſh was formed out of the ſubſtance of a Virgin in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous and extraordinary manner, that ſo he, though like to us in all things, might not be like to us in ſin; that he might partake of our fleſh and blood in a pure and unſpotted way: here we ſee, purity was his prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, the common lot of our nature is corruption. It's true, the <hi>Pelagians</hi> are not afraid to aſſert, That Chriſt was free from all contagion of ſin;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auſt.</hi> ad <hi>Bon.</hi> l. 4. c. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentia propria &amp; gratia ſingulari, ſed communione na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae, quae omnibus ineſt infantibus;</hi> Not by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per excellency and ſingular grace; but by a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that nature which is in all Infants. But this is in effect to ſay, that the coming of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Virgin, the overſhadowing her by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Higheſt, were ſuperfluous and vain; all might have been as well in an ordinary way: this is to rob Chriſt of his prerogative, to bring down the Saviour to the common level of the ſaved, which can never indeed come to paſs. There is a great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Chriſt and us in this point; our bodies are formed in the ordinary courſe of nature, but his was formed in an extraordinary ſupernatural way. We were in <hi>Adam, ſecundum rationem ſeminalem;</hi> We deſcended from the ſeminal vertue in him. But he was in <hi>Adam</hi> only <hi>ſecundum ſubſtantiam corporalem;</hi> He took the materials of a body from the Virgin; but the <hi>modus conceptionis,</hi> the manner of framing of it,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60626:121"/>was ſupernatural. We come forth into the world by that common benediction, <hi>Increaſe and multiply;</hi> but he came into the fleſh by that ſingular promiſe, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head.</hi> We ſee here a plain difference. Hence it appears, that purity was a ſingular priviledg in Chriſts birth; and pollution is the common lot of ours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The capacity Chriſt ſtood in is to be noted. He was ſet up to be a common head of righteouſneſs and life; and that tells us, that before him there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, who by his fall was a common head of ſin and death. Famous is that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, <hi>If by one mans offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt. As by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men to juſtification of life. As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners; ſo by the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one, ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> We ſee here two heads, <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt, both are ſet before us, the one cannot be well known without the other; the Pagans know neither, Chriſtians muſt confeſs both. If they ſay, Chriſt is an head communicating righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and immortality to us; they muſt alſo ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> was an head communicating ſin and death to us; elſe the Apoſtles Parallel is vain and frivolous, in that Chriſt, who obeyed in a publick capacity, is oppoſed to <hi>Adam,</hi> who ſinned only in a private one. Both theſe heads muſt be admitted, or neither; if both, then there is ſin from <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs from Chriſt.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 190.</note> Thus St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Alius qui peccatorem conſtituit, alius qui juſtificat a peccato,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60626:121"/>alter in ſemine, alter in ſanguine;</hi> One <hi>Adam</hi> makes us ſinners, another makes us righteous; the one by his ſeed, the other by his blood: if neither, then the obedience of Chriſt is made fruitleſs and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Hence St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">De Nat. &amp; Grat. c. 6. &amp; 7.</note> That the Doctrine of Original ſin muſt be defended againſt the <hi>Pelagians, Ne evacuetur crux Chriſti,</hi> leſt the Croſs of Chriſt be made of no effect: According to the tenour of that place, one head cannot ſtand without the other. If <hi>Adam</hi> derive not ſin to us, neither doth Chriſt derive righteouſneſs; both muſt be only patterns; neither, communicative heads; which to ſay, is utterly to overturn the ſcope of the place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Saviour Chriſt inſtituted Baptiſm, and that for Infants; but if there be no Original pollution in them, What need a waſhing-ordinance for them? The waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their bodies, whoſe pure, innocent, undefiled Souls are uncapable of ſpiritual waſhing, is but a ſhadow without ſubſtance, a Sacrament without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal grace, a thing too inſignificant for Chriſt the Wiſdom of God to inſtitute. Hence when the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> on the one hand granted the Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and on the other denied Original ſin;<note place="margin">Contr. <hi>Jul.</hi> l. 3. c. 3.</note> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> ſaith, that they ſpoke wonderful things. <hi>In Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramento Salvatoris baptizantur, ſed non ſalvantur, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimuntur ſed non liberantur, lavantur ſed non abluun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi> In our Saviours Sacrament Infants are baptized, but not ſaved; redeemed, but not delivered; waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but not cleanſed. And a little after he asks, If they are ſaved, what was their ſickneſs? If delivered, what their ſervitude? If cleanſed, what their pollution? Take away the Doctrine of Original ſin, and the Baptiſm of Infants ſeems to be a very ridiculous
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60626:122"/>thing. To avoid this abſurdity, the <hi>Pelagians</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auſt.</hi> de Pecc. Orig. l. 2. c. 5.</note> That the Baptiſm of Infants was neceſſary, not becauſe there was any Original ſin in them; but that they might be capable of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But I anſwer, Where there is no defect, there is all due perfection. If Infants are pure and free from all ſin, then have they all the righteouſneſs and rectitude which ought to be in them; and if they have ſo, they are, without Baptiſm, capable of Heaven; or if they were not, the baptiſmal-waſhing, which imports pollution, ſeems to be a ceremony very unfit and incongruous to be applied to them who are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot, or to render them apt for Heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In and about the death of Chriſt, two things are conſiderable; The one is the horrible wickedneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> in crucifying him: The other is, The infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite merit which is in his death and ſacrifice. Both will manifeſt the Doctrine of Original ſin.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The horrible wickedneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying him will do it. The rottenneſs of the root ſhews it ſelf in the branches; the malignity of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin appears in actual ones, eſpecially in thoſe which are of a deeper ſtain than others are. It was the aggravation of <hi>Solomons</hi> ſin, that his heart was turned from the Lord, who had appeared to him twice, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.9. The more eminently God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us, the more aggravated are our actual ſins againſt him; and the more aggravated thoſe are, the more vile and venemous doth the inward root of them appear to be. When God appears to us in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is a beam from him more precious than a world, it ſpeaks deſperate corruption in men, that the brutal part ſhould uſurp and rule over it; that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60626:122"/>the vile ſenſual luſts ſhould tread down that Divine ſpark, and, as it were, annihilate it, that nothing of God might have place in the heart. When God further appeared in the Law and the Prophets, to raiſe up a purer knowledg of himſelf than was to be found in Reaſon, as it lay in the duſt and rubbiſh of the fall, it argues a greater pravity and malignity in men, that they ſhould murder his Prophets, and trample his Sacred Laws, the images of his holy Will, under their impure feet; this was in effect, as much as in them lay, to explode God out of his own world, and practically to ſay, that he ſhould not reign there. When God yet more eminently appeared, when he ſent his own Son, very God of God, to be manifeſt in the fleſh; whoſe glory broke forth moſt illuſtriouſly in excellent Doctrines and Miracles; whoſe whole life among men was nothing but innocency, purity, mercy, meekneſs, goodneſs, humility, love, zeal, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs, holineſs, obedience, and all manner of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in ſpotleſs perfection; one might have thought that men would have reverenced the Son; that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling-corruption, however it had rioted under o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſtations, would here have made a pauſe, and ſtood as one aſtonied and over-awed at ſo ſtupendious an appearance, infinitely tranſcending all other: For what is the little ſpark of Reaſon, to the brightneſs of Gods glory? Or the Law in the letter, to incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sanctity and Holineſs? Or what are all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to him who came out of the Fathers boſom, and brought down ſupernatural Myſteries into the world? Here it might have been expected, that Iniquity ſhould have ſtopt her mouth, and held her hands; that the Divine Majeſty of this appearance ſhould have
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60626:123"/>made Corruption to retire, and hide it ſelf in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the heart. But alas, the event was quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; Original Corruption here did its utmoſt, and ſhewed forth all its malignity; the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> cried out, <hi>This is the heir, come let us kill him:</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, raged, blaſphemed, perſecuted, apprehended, accuſed, condemned, buffeted, and at laſt crucified the Lord of Glory. Oh matchleſs wickedneſs! never did Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin ſo fully diſcover it ſelf, never did the Hell in the <hi>Belial</hi>-heart ſo deſperately break forth as here. We ſee here our Corruption in its true colours and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; it is the root and fountain of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties; Antichriſt-like, it oppoſes all that is called God; it would have nothing of God remain; it would trample down every appearance of him, not in Reaſon or Laws only, but in his own Son, in God incarnate; and, were it poſſible, it would even cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and annihilate the Deity it ſelf: rather than part with its dear luſts, it would have God ceaſe to be.</p>
               <p>The next thing conſiderable, is the infinite Merit in Chriſts death: it procured two things for us, Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Salvation. Firſt, It procured Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us: This is a moſt precious thing, it new-frames and new-moulds us; it produces a new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual being; it draws the Divine image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon the heart; it ſets the ſoul into an holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and rectitude; and whence is it but from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? Or how is that procured, but by Chriſt and his ſweet-ſmelling Sacrifice? The Apoſtle tells us, That the Holy Ghoſt which renews us, is <hi>ſhed on us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour,</hi> Tit. 3.5, 6. Through him it is that the Holy Spirit comes down and effects this excellent work in us. Again, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60626:123"/>Salvation for us. That we are ſaved from our ſpiritual enemies, that we are at laſt crowned with life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal, it is from Jeſus Chriſt alone. Hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls him <hi>the author of eternal ſalvation,</hi> Heb. 5.9; not the Miniſter, but the Author of it, meritoriouſly procuring, and efficaciouſly giving it to his people. But now if there be no ſuch thing as Original ſin, much of the precious purchaſe of Chriſt muſt be loſt; he purchaſed Regeneration, but there being no Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, where or in whom will it be neceſſary? What, in Infants? In thoſe pure innocent ſouls there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be healed, nothing to be mended or new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made; where there is no ataxy of ſin, there all is in order and harmony; where there is no turpitude of ſin, there all is in ſplendor and glory: here's no need at all of Regeneration. Hence, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auſt.</hi> de Pec. Or. l. 2. c. 29.</note> the <hi>Pelagians</hi> denying Original ſin, were under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to ſay, That Infants did not <hi>indigere medico,</hi> want the Phyſician Jeſus: and upon this that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Father paſſes this cenſure, That therein they er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not in ſome light matter, but <hi>in ipſa regula fidei,</hi> in the very Rule of Faith by which we are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Or what, in the Adult? I anſwer, They which are without Original ſin, may live without Actual: therefore the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who denied Original ſin, held, very conſonantly to their Principles, That men might live without ſin. Thus they argued:<note place="margin">

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60626:124"/>good: <hi>Adam,</hi> while totally void of ſin, might have kept himſelf ſo: Why may not all others, if void of Original ſin, do ſo? Having no inward corruption to intice or draw them away unto ſin, they may live without it. Here again there is no need of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. To go on a little further: Suppoſe a man do fall into one act of ſin; yet one act of ſin, if we believe the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

Rel. l 5. c. 18.</note> cannot corrupt the human nature or Will; the man may riſe again by his own Will, and all will be well again. As yet there is no need of Regeneration. Nay, ſuppoſe a man to fall into an habit or cuſtom of ſin, in ſome degree, yet why may not the Will, that noble Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of freedom, extricate it ſelf? The Corruption is not ſeated in nature, but in a contracted habit; why may not the Will by contrary acts unravel that habit, and rid it ſelf of it? And that habit or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being gone, what need would there be of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation? An outward Reformation may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but what need of Regeneration? That in Scripture is the renovation of a man originally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted: Hence our Saviour preſſing the neceſſity of Regeneration, doth not urge it from the actual ſins of men, but from their natural pravity: <hi>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh,</hi> Joh. 3.6: that is, thoſe who have only a carnal generation, and ſo are origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally corrupt, are corrupt; therefore they ſtand in need of Regeneration, or the participation of a new ſpiritual nature. But if there be no ſuch thing as Original corruption, then according to our Saviour's argument, which preſſes it from thence, there is no need at all of Regeneration. Accordingly it may be obſerved, that thoſe men who deny Original ſin, do
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60626:124"/>extremely fumble and ſlubber over that great point of Regeneration, for the moſt part confounding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Principles with outward Actions.<note place="margin">De Ver. Relig. lib. 4. cap. 4.</note>

Much after the ſame rate ſpeak ſome other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, who, not in expreſs terms denying Original ſin, do yet leſſen and diminiſh it; their diſcourſes of Regeneration proportionable to their Principles, have but little ſavour or ſpiritual reliſh in them: upon the whole matter, we ſee that there is little need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. Again, Chriſt purchaſed Salvation, but there being no ſuch thing as Original ſin, Who ſhall be ſaved by him? Shall infants be ſaved by him? Indeed, of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven, but what are they ſaved from? Is it from ſin? There is no ſpot in them; Chriſt came in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, they do no more; they have no real fleſh of corruption in them. Is it from wrath? There can be none due to ſinleſs creatures. Is it from Satan? He may come and find nothing in them, nothing belonging to his black King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Is it from the world? They are not yet men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, morally entred into it, ſo as as to be capable of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60626:125"/>falling into the ſnares of it; there is therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all for infants to be ſaved from. Hence the Fathers in the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> do in their Epiſtle to Pope<note n="*" place="margin">Non eſt quod in eis ſalvetur, vel tanto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio redimatur, nihil eſt in eis vitiatum, nihil ſub diaboli poteſtate cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum, nec pro eis fuſus eſt ſanguis in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionem peccatorum. <hi>Crab. Conc. Tom.</hi> 1. fo. 470.</note> 
                  <hi>Innocent</hi> tell us, That according to the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians,</hi> there is nothing in Infants to be ſaved or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; nothing vitiated or held under the power of the Devil; neither was blood ſhed for their remiſſion. Hence St.<note n="†" place="margin">Qui dicit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantilem aeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere quod ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet Jeſus, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus fidelibus infantibus Chriſtum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat eſſe Jeſum, Jeſus quid eſt? interpretatur Jeſus ſalvator, ſalvator eſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; quos non ſalvat, non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendo in eis quod ſalvet, non eſt illis Jeſus. <hi>Auſt.</hi> de <hi>Verb.</hi> Apoſt.

                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> argues thus, He that ſaith, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have nothing to be ſaved from, denies Chriſt to be a Jeſus to them. What is Jeſus? Jeſus is by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation a Saviour, a Saviour is Jeſus; thoſe whom he doth not ſave, becauſe they have nothing to be ſaved from, he is not to them a Jeſus. Thus we ſee, that there being no Original ſin, Infants (which what Chriſtian heart can bear?) are not ſaved by Chriſt. Shall the adult be ſaved by him? As I noted before, they who are without Original ſin, may live without actual; and ſo, being void of all ſin, are uncapable of being ſaved, becauſe they have no ſin to be ſaved from. It was the opinion of<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> That Chriſt was, <hi>aliorum ſalvator, aliorum ſuſceptor,</hi> the Saviour of ſome, the Suſceptor of others; the firſt were drawn in by Grace, the ſecond prevented Grace. This made <hi>Proſper</hi> ſay, <hi>Huic ſententiae is poteſt prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere conſenſum, qui ſe a Chriſto non vult eſſe ſalvatum.</hi> He may conſent to this opinion, who would not be ſaved by Chriſt. <hi>Caſſianus</hi> denied Original ſin; he thought, that in the firſt ſin <hi>Adam</hi> only ſinned, that the Will in us is as free to good, as it was in <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall; and hence he held, That the Church was particoloured, part of it was juſtified by Grace, part by Freewill. Theſe latter, whom nature advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, were more glorious than thoſe whom grace freed: Theſe latter were uncapable of being ſaved,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60626:125"/>becauſe they had nothing to be ſaved from. Hence it follows, That Chriſt is not the Saviour of all his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but of part of it; that he ſaves not all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their ſins, but ſome. We ſee clearly by theſe things, that if Original ſin be denied, much of Chriſts purchaſe will be made fruitleſs and of no effect. As therefore we would have a part in Chriſt and his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, we muſt confeſs our ſelves to be pieces of old <hi>Adam,</hi> and to have a ſhare in his ſin.</p>
               <p>It being certain, That there is corruption in us, we ſhould reflect and take notice of it. This is that which depraves the whole man, and turns him into a man of ſin: every faculty groans under the burden of it, every part hath its wounds and putrifying ſores. The Underſtanding, a ſpark of immortality, is dropt out of its orb, fallen from the firſt truth and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of light; darkneſs covers it, a black vail holds back its eyes from the glories and beauties of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual world. The Thoughts, which are the firſt-born of the mind, are vain empty things, like the Fools eyes in the ends of the earth, gariſh and running up and down from one thing to another, having no more dependance than is in the broken words or ſpeeches of diſtracted men; like Quickſilver never fixed, unleſs it be upon trifles or ſinful objects. The Will, the principle of liberty, turns away from the ſupreme good; as a ſlave it lies in the chains of luſt, impotent, and in it ſelf unable to lift up a choice or option towards happineſs: its averſeneſs to that good which would ennoble and beautifie it, reproaches it with the fall; its propenſity to that evil, which ſoils and deturpates it, upbraids it as an apoſtate from its original. The Affections have loſt their wings, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60626:126"/>ſink down to the lower world as their center; there they lye in the mire and turpitude of inordinate luſts, and without the elevations of Grace they cannot raiſe up ſo much as a deſire towards the things above: they are Apoſtates from Heaven, and Rebels againſt that Reaſon which came down from thence to reign over them. The Members of the Body, are all inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of iniquity, ready to execute all the commands of ſin; the whole man is overſpread with an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal contagion. This is the root of bitterneſs, the ſeed of all manner of impieties. Every one doth not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſay with <hi>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord?</hi> Nor with the bloody <hi>Jew, Crucifie the Son of God;</hi> nor like the proud Antichriſt, exalt himſelf above God: but all theſe are ſeminally in us, there is <hi>aliquid intus,</hi> ſomewhat in every ones heart anſwering thereunto. There is that in us, which would trample down every appearance of God in Reaſon, ſacred Laws, holy Motions, offers of Grace; nay, and that which, if it were poſſible, would annihilate God himſelf. This is an abyſs of all evil, this is a black chaos which hath all manner of iniquities in it; and upon the warmth of temptation, will be ready to bring them forth into act. Oh! What matter of lamentation is here? How ſhould we mourn over this innate corruption? Is it nothing to us to have immortal ſpirits void of God and all ſpiritual perfections? Nothing, to have a Reaſon without light, a Will without liberty? Nothing, to have a troubled ſea of inordinate paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and innumerable luſts creaking there? Nothing, to carry an Hell in our own boſom, to have an enmity againſt that good, which, if received, would perfect and make us happy; and a proneneſs to that evil,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60626:126"/>which, being imbraced, will corrupt and make us mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable for ever? May we here ſpare our tears? Or can we do leſs than fill our ſelves with ſhame and ſelf-abhorrency? <hi>Paulinus</hi> would not let his Picture be drawn, becauſe of the in-dwelling ſin. <hi>Erubeſco pingere quod ſum,</hi> ſaid he; I bluſh to paint what I am. St. <hi>Paul</hi> cryes out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death!</hi> Rom. 7.24. How ſadly ſhould we look upon that forlorn ſpectacle, I mean our corrupt ſelves! How ſhould we lothe our ſelves, and lye low at Gods feet, if peradventure he may give us a better nature! Of what vaſt concern is it to wait upon God in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and by ardent devotions to preſs into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that there may be a new-creation in us! And when that great work is wrought in us, How ſhould we lift up free-grace, and ſing <hi>Hoſanna's</hi> to it for ever! How often ſhould we have that in our mouths, What hath God wrought! We marred the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he hath ſet up a ſecond. We lay in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the fall, and he came down thither to rear up his own image in us again. Graces are now grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, where ſin had its ſeat; the Holy Spirit now inhabits there, where Satan dwelt and reigned: And what an excellent change is this! Let us diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh our ſelves according to the two <hi>Adams.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is vitious or defective in us, relates to the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> whatever is gracious or perfective of our nature, relates to the ſecond. Never can we be too humble under the ſenſe of Original corruption which adheres to our nature. Never can we be too thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for that ſupernatural grace which gave us a new nature. Becauſe we have a Divine nature in us, we
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60626:127"/>ſhould live ſutably to it. Had we had but one ſingle creation, we had been eternally bound to ſerve and glorifie God; but when he ſets to his hand the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, to create us again in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, how ſhould our lives anſwer thereunto! When in the horrible Earthquake at <hi>Antioch</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Trajanus</hi> was drawn out of the ruines, it was a very great obligation upon him to ſerve and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God who ſo ſignally delivered him; how much greater obligation lyes upon us, who are drawn by an act of grace out of the ruines of the fall? How ſhould we live in a juſt decorum to that Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which we are made partakers of! We ſhould ſtill be bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit, and ſhewing forth the praiſes of him who hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvelous light. Again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the reliques of corruption are ſtill remaining even in the regenerate, we ſhould ever be upon our ſpiritual watch; we ſhould ſet guards within and without, that ſin may not creep in by the ports of ſenſe, nor riſe up out of the deep of the heart. When a temptation approaches to us, we ſhould ſay as an holy man did, <hi>Auferte ignem, adhuc enim pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas habeo;</hi> Take away the fire, yet I have chaff with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. If a <hi>Jonah</hi> fall into a pet againſt God; if a <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> wallow in adultery and blood; if a <hi>Peter</hi> deny his Lord with a curſe, What may not we do! The remnants of Original ſin in us, ſhould make us keep a watch over our hearts, and ponder the path of our feet. Our fleſh is an <hi>Eve,</hi> a Tempter within us; nay, a kind of Devil, as an Ancient ſpeaks, <hi>Nemo ſibi de ſuo palpet, quiſque ſibi Satan eſt.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>HAVING ſpoken of Original Sin, I ſhall next conſider of Grace, which heals that deadly wound. Grace, in the primary notion of it, is the Love and Good-will of God towards ſinners; and in a ſecondary ſenſe, it is thoſe ſaving-gifts which are derived from that Love. Theſe are called Graces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they lye in mans heart, as beams of that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grace which is in Gods; and tend to that Glory in Heaven which is Grace conſummate. Gods will goes foremoſt, and works thoſe Graces in mans, which make him meet for eternal happineſs. The fountain of Grace is the free-love of God; the ſtreams of it are ſupernatural gifts in men; the center of it is the glory of Heaven. Theſe things ſhew us the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace.</p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:60626:128"/>
               <p n="1">1. The Fountain of Grace is Gods free Love, which moves it ſelf, and gratuitouſly flows out in ſpiritual bleſſings; theſe iſſue out of love, and that is a motive to it ſelf. Emphatical is that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>If by grace, then it is no more of works; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe grace is no more grace: but if it be of works, then it is no more grace; otherwiſe work is no more work,</hi> Rom. 11.6. It is eſſential to Grace to be gratuitous; unleſs it be ſo, it loſes its nature. Upon this account <hi>Pelagius,</hi> that Enemy of Grace, but for his counterfeit Recantation, had had in the <hi>Paleſtine</hi> Council a juſt <hi>Anathema</hi> for that ſaying, <hi>Gratiam dari ſecundum merita,</hi> That Grace was given according to merits or works.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auſt.</hi> Hyp. l. 3.</note> When the <hi>Pelagians</hi> ſaid, <hi>Quia ego prior volui, Deus voluit,</hi> Becauſe I firſt willed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God willed; Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells them, That they brought in Merit, that Grace was then no longer Grace: <hi>In omni opere ſancto,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>prior eſt volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Dei, poſterior liberi arbitrii;</hi> In every holy work Gods will is firſt in order,<note place="margin">Si vel tantil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum boni a Deo non eſt, jam non om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis boni eſſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor eſt. eo<expan>

                  </note> and then mans. Without this order, Grace cannot be Grace, nor God God. If he be not the Fountain of all good, if the leaſt good ſtart up and anticipate his will, he is not, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him, the origine of all good. The Fountain of Grace muſt therefore be in his Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſtreams of it are Supernatural Gifts. It's true, natural benefits are in ſome ſenſe grace; but this is not the noted acception of the word in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This acception was but <hi>Pallium Pelagianorum,</hi> the <hi>Pelagians</hi> cloak under which they hid their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. Hence,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auſt.</hi> Epiſt. 105.</note> when that queſtion was asked, What that Grace was which <hi>Pelagians</hi> thought was given without any precedent merits? Anſwer was made,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60626:128"/>That it was the humane nature, in which we were made; for before we were, we could not merit a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus they confounded Grace and Nature to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but the gifts of Grace are above the ſphear of Nature, and altogether undue to it. Indeed in Innocency righteouſneſs was natural to man, not that it was a principle of Nature, or an emanation from thence; but that it was neceſſary and due to that Integrity, which God would ſet up the human nature in. God would make man very good, and how that could be without righteouſneſs, I know not. Moral goodneſs, is that which is proper to a reaſonable creature; neither can it be wanting, but there will be a maim in the creature. There was in man an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of rational powers, in which he had communion with Angels; and ſenſitive, in which he had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Beaſts. This Union could not be made in a perfect orderly manner, unleſs the ſenſitive powers, being the more ignoble, were ſubjected to the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, being the more excellent faculties; that ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could not be without a righteouſneſs. This is the rectitude and harmony of humane nature: without it all the parts and powers of the Soul muſt needs jangle into confuſion. God would have man to ſerve and obey him in a perfect manner; And how could this be without a principle of holy love? Which way ſhould there be actual righteouſneſs without ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal? Without an internal rectitude, man could not love God, as he ought, <hi>amore amicitiae,</hi> with a love of friendſhip, for his own ſake; and without ſuch a love, referring all to God and his glory, all mans acts, <hi>a primo ad ultimum,</hi> muſt needs be ſin. God would ſet before a man a moſt glorious end, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the beatifical viſion: And how ſhould man
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60626:129"/>ever arrive at it without righteouſneſs? Or want that righteouſneſs which qualifies for it? Such a want would ſet him below the moſt contemptible creatures; none of which are deſtitute of that furniture, which is requiſite for the reaching of their ends. In all theſe reſpects, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs was natural, and in a ſort due unto man in Innocency. But after mans fall and forfeiture of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal righteouſneſs, ſaving gifts are altogether ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; not only as being above the power of nature, but as being totally undue to it. To the ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, righteouſneſs was in a ſenſe due; but to the ſtate of Corruption, there was nothing due but wrath.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The center of it is the Glory of Heaven; Grace prepares a Kingdom for Believers. Hence God bids them, come and inherit the Kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the World, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.34; it prepares them for the Kingdom. Hence that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Giving thanks to the father, who hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the ſaints in light,</hi> Col. 1.12. The firſt riſe of Grace, is in the boſom of eternal love; the appearance of it in men, is in ſupernatural gifts: the period and center of it, is in the Glory of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Two things in this point of Grace offer themſelves to our conſideration; the freeneſs of Grace, and the Divine efficacy of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The freeneſs of Grace is to be conſidered, and that in two or three particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is of Free-Grace, that all mankind doth not eternally periſh in the ruines of the fall: That there is a poſſibility of Salvation for any one Son of <hi>Adam.</hi> When the Angels ſinned but one ſin, God turned them down into chains of darkneſs for ever: Might he not in juſtice have dealt ſo with fallen men? He
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60626:129"/>was not bound to repair the Angels, thoſe golden Veſſels, once inmates of Heaven; and who can, who dares conceive ſuch a thought, That he was bound to repair men who are but Images of clay, dwelling in the lower World? I know many differences are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, Man ſinned by ſeduction, Devils by ſelf-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in the fall of Man, all the human nature fell; in the fall of Angels, all the Angelical nature fell not. The ſin of Angels was more damnable than Mans, becauſe their nature was more ſublime than his. Men are capable of repentance, but Devils not; becauſe whatever they once chooſe, they do will immovably. But alas! all theſe are but <hi>extra</hi>-Scriptural conjectures. Man, though tempted, was voluntary in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; all men were involved in the fall, but that's no apology for the ſin: The ſin of Man, if not ſo high as that of Angels, was yet a damnable one. It is a vain dream, to ſuppoſe, that Almighty Grace could not have wrought a gracious change in Devils. That which differences us from them, is, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, no other, than the meer Grace and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropy of God towards us; he might juſtly have left us under that wrath, which our apoſtacy deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Two things will make this evident.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Original ſin, which reaches to all, is properly ſin; and, being ſuch, merits no leſs than eternal death. We all ſinned in <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, by that one man, <hi>ſin entred into the world:</hi> The diſobedience of that one, conſtituted all ſinners; which unleſs it had been imputatively theirs, it could never have done. The want of Original righteouſneſs is properly ſin. becauſe it is the want of that which ought to be in us; it ought to be in us, becauſe the pure ſpiritual
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60626:130"/>Law calls for an holy frame of heart: it ought to be in us, or elſe we are not fallen creatures, but are as we ought to be: If it ought to be in us, then the want of it is properly ſin. The Apoſtle proving that all are ſinners, and ſhort of the Glory of God, tells us, That <hi>there is none righteous, no not one; none that underſtandeth, none that ſeeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way. They are together become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. There is no fear of God before their eyes, Rom.</hi> 3. Which words denote a want of that habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual righteouſneſs which ought to be in all, even in little Infants: That want is ſin, elſe the Apoſtle could not from thence conclude, That all, Infants not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God. To want habitual righteouſneſs, which ought to be in us, is to be ſinners, and ſhort of our origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. That original concupiſcence, which is in all, is properly ſin; it is over and over called ſin in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is the root and black fountain of all impiety, it is oppoſite to the Law and Spirit of God, it impels to all ſin, it fights againſt all graces, and particularly againſt that of love to God: where the creature is inordinately loved, there God is not loved with all the heart and Soul. Theſe things make it appear, That Original ſin is properly ſin; and if ſo, it merits no leſs than death eternal. The Scripture abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifieth this, <hi>The wages of ſin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 6.23. In which we have a double An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis, Wages is oppoſed to Gift; and eternal Death to eternal Life. <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin,</hi> Rom. 5.12: Not meer infelicity, but ſin entred; not meer temporal death, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60626:130"/>followed upon it. Hence the Apoſtle tells us, That there was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, judgment unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and that upon all men, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, and 18. <hi>We are by nature children of wrath, even as others,</hi> Eph. 2.3. He doth not ſay, by practiſe or cuſtom; but by nature, we are Children of wrath, that is, worthy of it. Nature, as corrupted, is here oppoſed to Grace; which, as the Text after ſpeaks, ſaves us: wrath appertains to nature, ſalvation to grace.

If Original ſin be indeed ſin, and do merit death eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, then God may juſtly inflict that death for it,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60626:131"/>ſeeing he cannot be unjuſt in doing an act of juſtice, in inflicting that puniſhment, which is due to ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As on Mans part there is a merit of eternal death; ſo on Gods, the miſſion of Chriſt to ſave us was an act of meer Grace. This is ſet forth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>God commended his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us,</hi> Rom. 5.8. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſent his only begotten ſon into the world, that we might live through him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.9. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten ſon, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</hi> Joh. 3.16. We ſee here, the ſending of a Saviour was an act of meer Grace; and Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurely free and ſelf-moving, might have ſuſpended its own act; and that ſuſpenſion, had it been, would have left all men in the ruines of the fall, and that without any colour of injuſtice at all in God. There is a vaſt difference between mercy in Man, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in God; Man ſhews it <hi>ex officio,</hi> out of duty, and in every failure he is unmerciful: but God ſhews it, <hi>ex arbitrio,</hi> out of Sovereignty, in ſuch ſort as he pleaſes; and to do more he is not obliged. Hence Gods Purpoſe and Grace are joined together, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. His Mercy, though an infinite Ocean, lets not out a drop towards fallen creatures, but according to his good pleaſure: If God antecedently to his own decree and promiſe, was bound to ſend his Son to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt; then the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, was not an act of grace, but of juſtice and neceſſity: it muſt, it ought to be ſo; the Grace and Love revealed in the Goſpel, is a meer nullity, a thing no way free or gratuitous: but if, as the truth
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60626:131"/>is, God were not bound to ſend a Saviour, then he might have ſuſpended his own act, and left all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the ruins of the fall.</p>
               <p>No man who believes theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> That Original ſin is ſin, and merits wrath; That the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Saviour is Grace and ſelf-moving; can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiby have hard thoughts of Gods Decree in the point of Reprobation. We being by Original ſin in a ſtate of wrath, what might not God do with us? Might he not juſtly leave us in the corrupt Maſs? Or might he not juſtly puniſh us there? If not leave us; then, as he would be juſt, he was bound to give a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and by conſequence the giving of him (which is <hi>horrendum dogma</hi>) is no more Grace or Mercy, but Neceſſity: If not puniſh us, then as he would be juſt, he was bound not to do an act of Juſtice; I mean, not to inflict that death which is as due wages to every ſin. To me it is clear, That God cannot be cruel or unjuſt, either in denying a Redemption purely gratuitous, or in inflicting a death juſtly due to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creature.<note place="margin">Epiſt. 105.</note> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> brings in the <hi>Pelagians</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring thus: <hi>Injuſtum eſt in una eadem<expan>

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60626:132"/>reaſon of complaint either way. It is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that thoſe who deny Reprobation, do either in whole or in part deny Original ſin, ſaying that it is no ſin, or, which is all one, improperly ſuch; or elſe they have no true notion of Grace in the freeneſs and ſelf-motion of it. And to do either, what is it? To deny Original ſin, is to contradict the Letter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the judgment of the Church; nay, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all men who will but reflect upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. To deny Grace to be free and ſelf-moving, is to ſay Grace is not Grace, and to evacuate the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and to take away the glory of it. Neither of them may be done by any who calls himſelf Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. The true notion of Sin is, That it is ſuch a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Law, as merits death eternal. The true notion of Grace is, That it operates freely and of ſelf-motion. God, though under no neceſſity, though he might have left faln men as well as faln Angels, under ſin and wrath, was yet pleaſed out of his meer good pleaſure to give a Saviour unto men, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a dore to them of ſalvation. This is free-Grace indeed, and for ever to be adored. Thus much touching the firſt thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is of free-Grace that God chuſes a Church and people to himſelf; that he deſigns ſome certain individual perſons to the infallible attainment of Grace and Glory. And here I ſhall conſider two things; firſt, That there is ſuch an Election. And then, That it iſſues out of meer Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is ſuch an Election of men unto Grace and Glory. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>He hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world,</hi> Eph. 1.4. <hi>He predeſtinated us to the adoption of children by Jeſus
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60626:132"/>Chriſt,</hi> ver. 5. In the clearing of this I ſhall lay down ſeveral things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Election is not of all, but ſome. It's true, <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berus</hi> aſſerted an univerſal election of all men: But this is directly oppoſite to Scripture. <hi>Few,</hi> not all, <hi>are choſen,</hi> Mat. 22.14. The elect are oppoſed to the blinded ones, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7; a clear diſtinction is made between veſſels of honour and diſhonour, between veſſels of mercy and wrath, between thoſe that are written in the book of Life, and thoſe that are left out of it. Election is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> it ſeparates and fingles out ſome to mercy in a way of choice. Were it of all, it could not be Election, there could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of choice in it. The Elect are ſaid to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19: but all are not choſen out of all, that's impoſſible. Election there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is of ſome individual perſons only: <hi>The Lord knoweth thoſe that are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. Their names are all down in the book of life. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, this individual perſon, this very <hi>Paul,</hi> who but now was breathing out blood againſt the Church, this is a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of election, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15, ſaith God to <hi>Ananias.</hi> The elect are called a remnant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5, becauſe it is made up of ſome individual perſons ſpecially ſingled out of the corrupt maſs unto God. The will of Gods Complacence reſpects Graces without a diſtinction of perſons; <hi>Every one that fears God, is accepted,</hi> Acts 10.35. <hi>A good man draws out favour from the Lord,</hi> Prov. 12.2. But the will of Gods Benevolence, ſuch as Election is, is diſtinctive of perſons; for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees certain bleſſings to certain perſons, and not to all. Election therefore is not of all, but of ſome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Election is not Legiſlation. The ſecret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60626:133"/>of Princes are not their Edicts; neither is Gods Election a Legiſlation. Election is an Eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, Legiſlation is in time. Election is but of ſome, Legiſlation extends to all. Election is that Decree, according to which God gives out ſpiritual bleſſings to ſome as a Benefactor: Legiſlation ſets down that Rule, according to which God deals with all as a Rector who governs by Law. In the Covenant of Works, that <hi>[do this and live]</hi> was not Election; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the oppoſite member therein <hi>[tranſgreſs and dye]</hi> Reprobation. In the Covenant of Grace, that <hi>[believe and be ſaved]</hi> is not Election; neither is the oppoſite branch therein <hi>[believe not and be damned]</hi> Reprobation; for then all men, becauſe they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both parts of the Evangelical Law, ſhould be both elected and reprobated, which is impoſſible: nay, becauſe they were in <hi>Adam</hi> their head under both parts of the firſt Covenant, they ſhould be once before both elected and reprobated. It is one thing to preſcribe the terms of ſalvation, another to chuſe men to it: one thing to write down Laws for all, another to write down the names of ſome in the book of Life. That general Law, <hi>All that believe ſhall be ſaved,</hi> predeſtinates none in particular. It would ſtand true, if all men were left in unbelief and perdition; If there were no ſuch thing as a Church in all the world, but elective; if it ſecure not a Church to God, is altogether inſignificant. It is an election of none, that is, no election. Our Saviour ſets down two wills of God as diſtinct; <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, That every one that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 6.40. And in the precedent verſe, <hi>This is the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60626:133"/>Fathers will, which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing.</hi> In the one we have Gods legiſlative Will defining the terms of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all; in the other, we have Gods elective Will deſigning ſome, that is, the elect, the given ones to it: The firſt without terms in it, would not be Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the latter without perſons in it, would not be Election.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Election, being a chuſing, a ſingling out ſome to eternal life, muſt needs do ſome ſingular thing for them; it muſt confer upon them ſome diſtinguiſhing Grace, ſuch as may reſerve them out of the corrupt Maſs unto God: And what Grace is that but Faith? If all men did believe, there would be no <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or difference among them; the righteouſneſs of God would be upon them all, the rivers of living water would flow in them all, the Glory of Heaven would crown them all. But Faith is a differencing Grace, proper to Gods peculiar ones; it is not given to all, but to ſome; not out of common Providence, but out of Election: It is a choice, a prime Grace of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and therefore in all congruity muſt needs iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue out of the great deſign of Secretion, that is, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. If God give alike to all, then he elects none, he differences none; however men may make themſelves to differ, God doth no ſuch thing, nor ever intended to do ſo: Thus Election is a meer nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But if, as the truth is, there be any ſuch thing as Election, then it beſtows upon the choſen ones, thoſe ſpecial love-tokens of Faith and Perſeverance, which make them meet for Heaven and eternal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Election is a ſure infallible thing, ſuch as never
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60626:134"/>fails: Hence it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Praedeſtination, or praedefinition, ſuch as never miſſes the mark. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called; whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified,</hi> Rom. 8.30. The words (<hi>whom</hi> and <hi>them</hi>) faſten every link to its precedent, and appropriate all throughout the whole chain to the ſame perſons: every perſon, who is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated and called within this Text, muſt be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and glorified, or the golden chain of Grace is broken. <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, the Lord knoweth them that are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. Election is a foundation, not an human one, but a foundation of God, laid in the Divine Will, ſtanding in eternity, ſure in immutability, ſealed up with infallible knowledg and unvariable love towards the elect: Nothing is more momentous than this, That God have a Church, Chriſt a Body, and the Spirit a Temple. This is the higheſt of deſigns, the aim of the Sacred Trinity, the very thing upon which God hath ſet his eyes and his heart more than upon all the world beſides; yet if Election be not ſure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, that high and precious deſign may be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and of no effect: And what a blot would this be to Providence? And how unbecoming would it be to the Holy one, who ſits at the Stern and rules all? If ſo accurate a thing as Providence could, which it cannot without diſparaging it ſelf, ſtumble or faulter in the things of nature; yet ſurely it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do ſo in its maſter-piece, in the high and precious concerns of Grace: Election therefore muſt be ſure and infallible.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Volk</hi> l. 5. c. 17. de praedeſt.</note> That diſtinction of the <hi>Socinians</hi> (that there is a double Election in God, an infirm
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60626:134"/>one of thoſe, who aſſent to the Goſpel, and a firm one of thoſe, who live according to the Goſpel) is frivolous and blaſphemous; it is in effect to ſay, that there is infirmity in God, that Gods choice is weak or rather none at all, and mans choice ſupplies and ſtrengthens it. The great deſign of a Church could not be ſecured by ſuch a choice as mans, nor by any thing leſs than Gods; his Election is a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his ſpecial call according to purpoſe, and his gifts without repentance. Hence it appears, That according to the opinion of the Remonſtrants, there is indeed no ſuch thing as Election. They ſay, that the object of Election is a Believer; and, whether there ſhall be a Believer or not, after all the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Grace, ultimately depends upon the Will of Man: And if ſo, How can God elect any one perſon in the world? The act of his Election depends upon the object, and the object upon the will of Man; Mans will muſt go foremoſt, and make the object; or elſe for want of one, Gods Will muſt ſtand ſtill, and not chuſe at all. It's true, God hath ſet down this Law or Rule, That believers ſhould be ſaved; but no-where hath he ſaid, that believers ſhould be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for that would overthrow his own Election, ſuppoſing ſuch a Law or Rule, That believers ſhould be elected. If a Man did believe, and ſo was elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would not be Gods firſt Law or after-choice, but mans faith which determined the matter: he would be his own elector; God in the mean time would not be an Elector, but a Legiſlator only. But a little further, to conſider the opinion of the Remonſtrants: They ſet down the order of Gods Decrees in this manner; upon <hi>Adams</hi> fall, there was a merciful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:60626:135"/>in God towards man; but, juſtice ſtanding in the way, a Mediator was ordained to offer up a propitiatory Sacrifice to God. Hereupon God makes a general Decree, That all perſevering believers ſhall be ſaved; and, becauſe man cannot believe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, God decrees, <hi>media ad fidem,</hi> means to beget Faith; and as ſoon as men believe, there is a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Decree for their Salvation; or a kind of incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Election, ſuch as riſes and falls with their Faith; and when they arrive at the full point of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the Election becomes compleat and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This is their Scheme; here many things are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, Here's a Mediator Decreed, without reſpect to that Church, which in Scripture is the choice mark aimed at in the work; here's a general Decree to ſave all perſevering believers, and in that inſtant, no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the <hi>media ad fidem,</hi> the means to beget Faith; here's a ſtrange imperfection attributed to God, his Will in its eternal acts muſt be in ſucceſſion, and make its gradual progreſſes from a general Decree to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and from an incompleat Election (I tremble at the word) to a compleat one; and in its paſſage to that compleature, it muſt all the way vary, and turn about to every point, as the fickle will of man doth; that ſtanding in Faith there is an Election, that falling there is none; and ſo, <hi>toties quoties,</hi> as often as it pleaſes man to ſhew himſelf variable, the Election will be ſomething or nothing as it happens. This doth not indeed aſcribe eyes and hands to God, as the groſs <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> did; but it aſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates him to the ſilly turnings and variations of the creature, which cannot but be very unworthy of him. Here is ſuch a particular Election as is temporal, and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60626:135"/>totally ſuperfluous: it is temporal; for if it depend upon perſevering faith as its condition, then it muſt be ſuſpended, and not in act, till that faith be in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It's condition being temporal, it cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſt or be eternal. It is alſo totally ſuperfluous, there being a general Decree of ſaving all perſevering believers once paſt, every individual man who is a perſevering believer, muſt needs infallibly arrive at Heaven without any more ado; and then to what purpoſe is ſuch a particular Election? Neither do I think, that the Remonſtrants would ever have offered ſuch an inſignificant thing to the world, but that they were under a neceſſity to ſay ſomewhat to thoſe many and famous expreſſions which are found in Scripture, touching the election and predeſtination of perſons, which could not be ſatisfied with that general Law, <hi>That whoſoever believeth ſhould be ſaved:</hi> Here's an election of perſevering believers; but in plain terms that is no election at all. Election muſt be to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but this is to juſt nothing: not to Faith and Holineſs, theſe are preſuppoſed in the object; and there can be no election to that which is preſuppoſed before. There is therefore no election to Grace at all. No, nor to Glory: That perſevering believers had a right unto by the general Decree of ſaving ſuch as they are; and there can be no election to that which they had an antecedent right unto. Thus all the great expreſſions in Scripture touching Election, vaniſh into nothing. In Election God ſevers and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences one man from another in a way of choice: but according to the Remonſtrants, he gives all in common. And how can God elect without a ſevering or differencing act? Or how can he do ſuch an act,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:60626:136"/>who gives all in common? It's true, God ſevers final believers to life, and final unbelievers to death; but here is no choice of perſons; ſome go to life, but all, if final believers, ſhould do ſo: ſome go to death, but all, if final unbelievers, ſhould do ſo. Here is no choice at all, but a meer judicial act, according to the Evangelical Law. When a Judg according to Law acquits one as innocent, and condemns another as guilty, it is not an act of choice, but of righteous judgment. No more is it in God to adjudg believers to life, and unbelievers to death. But I ſhall ſay no more touching the firſt thing, That there is an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Election is of meer Grace. It hath no other cauſe but the Divine pleaſure only. <hi>We are predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated according to the good pleaſure of his will,</hi> Eph. 1.5. <hi>To the praiſe of the glory of his grace,</hi> v. 6. God loves his people becauſe he loves them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.8. He ſaith, <hi>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious,</hi> Exod. 33.19. In which words we have <hi>will</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> doubled as the only reaſon of it ſelf. Election is the <hi>primum indebitum;</hi> if that be not purely free in God,<note place="margin">Conſ. ad Pol. cap. 29.</note> nothing can be ſo. <hi>Iniquus eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca, qui muneris ſui arbitrium danti non reliquit;</hi> He is unjuſt who leaves not a gift to the pleaſure of the giver. All ſouls and graces are Gods, and he may diſpoſe of them as he pleaſeth. If he chuſe any to himſelf, he chuſes freely, elſe it is no choice at all: it is not, as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>an election of Grace.</hi> Election is not built upon foreſeen works, for then it would not be an election of Grace, but of Works; the elect would not be veſſels of Mercy, but of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: neither is it founded upon foreſeen faith and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60626:136"/>perſeverance; theſe are given by God not to all, but to ſome; not out of common Providence, but out of the Decree of Election. Hence the Apoſtle, when he bleſſes God for the work of Faith in the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> elevates his praiſes up to Election, the firſt fountain of Grace, <hi>Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4. And, when he praiſes God, for bleſſing the <hi>Epheſians</hi> with all ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in Chriſt, he ſets down the eternal rule of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing them, <hi>According as he hath choſen us, Epheſ.</hi> 1.3, 4. He doth not chooſe us according to our faith and perſeverance, but bleſſes us with theſe bleſſings according to Election; he chuſes us, not becauſe we are holy, but that we ſhould be ſuch: Doth God foreſee any good in men, when he willeth to them their firſt good? Or, Doth he foreſee good in them, before he wills it to them? What need then of his purpoſe to give it? Or how can he poſſibly be the Donor of it? If he foreſee it, they will infallibly have it, whether he Decree it or not; they will have it without his gift, which is impoſſible. Faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and perſeverance do not preſuppoſe Election, but Election is the eternal ſpring of thoſe graces. Unleſs this be granted, God doth but <hi>eligere eligentes,</hi> chuſe thoſe that firſt chuſe him: Mans faith muſt be earlier than Gods Grace, he chuſes before he is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen; loves before he is loved of God. And to aſſert this, What is it, but to lift up man above God, Mans Will above the Sovereign Will of his Maker? A vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is, and a blaſphemy againſt the fountain of Grace, which the Saints bleſs and adore, as the origine of all that good which is in them. Gods electing Grace, is pure Grace; his Love is meerly from himſelf:
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60626:137"/>Hence is that emphatical reduplication, <hi>The elect whom he hath choſen,</hi> Matt. 13.20. As if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had ſaid, in Election there is nothing but pure Election, nothing on mans part, all is from the good pleaſure of God.</p>
               <p>This Truth is notably ſet forth in our Saviour Chriſt, he was Gods choſen Servant, <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.18. The Lamb fore-ordained, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. And, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſtiles him, <hi>praeclariſſimum lumen praedeſtinationis &amp; gratiae,</hi> the moſt famous light of Praedeſtination and Grace. He was as man, predeſtinated to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative glory of the Hypoſtatical Union; and that not out of any foreſeen holineſs in his human nature, for all that did flow out of that union, but out of meer grace: the human nature did not do or merit ought to be advanced into that ineffable excellency; neither may any man ſay, <hi>Cur non &amp; ego?</hi> Why were not I ſo advanced? Nature is common, but Grace is ſingular. Here we have the Prototype and grand Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar of Predeſtination: Chriſt was predeſtinated to be the Head, we are predeſtinated to be his members. He as man was predeſtinated, that by an admirable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption he ſhould be the natural Son of God: We are predeſtinated, that we ſhould be adopted ones. He was predeſtinated to be ſuch without any prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent merits or works: We are predeſtinated to be ſuch without them. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That we are predeſtinated to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firſt-born among many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> Rom. 8.29. Both Predeſtinations were free; and in our Predeſtination there was a kind of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his.<note place="margin">De bono per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever. l. 2. c. 24.</note> Hence St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Et illum &amp; nos Praedeſtinavit, quia in illo, ut eſſet caput noſtrum, &amp;
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60626:137"/>in nobis, ut ejus corpus eſſemus, non praeceſſura merita no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra, ſed opera ſua futura praeſcivit;</hi> He predeſtinated him and us: that he ſhould be our Head, and we his Body, was not from our merit, but the work of God. It is certain, that the Members cannot be above the Head; they were not elected to a Beatifical Viſion out of foreſeen faith and perſeverance, when the Head was elected to the Hypoſtatical Union out of meer grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is of free grace that God calls men. There is a double call, an External and an Internal one; both are of grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The External call is of grace. The Goſpel is not a debt, but a meer gift freely given to men. It may be ſubſtracted from a Nation for their ſins, but it is never given to a Nation for their worthineſs, for all men are unworthy of it. When God gives it to ſome, it is not for their dignity; when he denies it to others, there is always in them a concomitant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity of it. No natural man can be worthy of it. It is meerly of Gods good pleaſure that the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhines in one part of the world, and not in another; that the Evangelical dew falls in ſome places, and not in others. Here the only ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is that of our Saviour, <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight,</hi> Mat. 11.26. I know it is here ſaid by ſome, That <hi>facienti quod in ſe eſt Deus non denegat gratiam;</hi> To him who doth what he can, God denies not grace. The promiſe is, <hi>Habenti dabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, To him that hath,</hi> that is, rightly uſeth what he hath, <hi>more ſhall be given.</hi> Upon the right uſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals, the <hi>Pagans</hi> might have ſupernaturals. The Goſpel in ſuch a caſe ſhould be revealed to them.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60626:138"/>But, as Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> obſerves, experience confutes this; <hi>Proferant ab orbe condito vel unius Pagani exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum,</hi> ſaith he;<note place="margin">Determ. f. 236.</note> Let them bring forth, if they can, the example of one <hi>Pagan</hi> ſince the world began, who by the right uſe of naturals attained to Evangelical Grace. One would think that ſuch as <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> might, if any, rightly uſe naturals; but they had not the Goſpel manifeſted to them, which yet hath been revealed to the poor <hi>Americans,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively to the other were brutiſh and barbarous. That of the Schools, <hi>Facienti quod in ſe eſt Deus non denegat gratiam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Serm: printed <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1632. fol. 286.</note> is (as Biſhop <hi>Saunderſon</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons calleth it) the rotten principle and foundation of the whole frame of <hi>Arminianiſm:</hi> ultimately it reſolves all into nature; Salvation is reſolved into Faith, Faith into the Goſpel preached, that into the uſe of naturals. Nature may now lift up its hand, and touch the Crowns of Glory above. Grace may fall down to ſo low a rate, as to be earned at the fingers ends of Nature. And what is this but pure impure <hi>Pelagianiſm?</hi> In the <hi>Paleſtine</hi> Synod <hi>Pelagius,</hi> but for his counterfeit recantation, had had a juſt <hi>anathema</hi> for that ſaying, <hi>Gratiam dari ſecundum merita. Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum merita</hi> with the Fathers, is all one with <hi>ſecundum opera,</hi> and <hi>ſecundum opera</hi> all one with <hi>facienti quod in ſe eſt.</hi> The Apoſtle flatly oppoſes this opinion; <hi>He hath called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. The call is not according to works, or according to the uſe of naturals; but meerly, purely, totally from Grace. Rightly to uſe naturals, is to live up to the light of nature; that tells us, that God is the Supreme good, and therefore in all reaſon to be
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60626:138"/>loved with a ſupreme love. We ſhould not give him part of the price, but all the mind, heart, ſoul, ſpirit, and that in pure perfection; and who, where is the Saint on earth that doth ſo? Their pureſt acts of love come forth <hi>ex laeſo principio,</hi> out of an heart ſanctified but in part; and in their egreſs from thence cannot but have a taint or tincture from the indwelling cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: and may we imagine that God ſhould offer the <hi>Pagans</hi> a Goſpel on ſuch terms as no Saint on earth ever arrived at? Or that he would have them go about by the way of perfection to enjoy a Goſpel of Grace? It cannot be. But ſuppoſe that they may have it upon a ſincere love of him; Can a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> out of natural Principles truly love God? May true Love be without Faith the Root, or without the Spirit, the inſpirer of all Graces? Or doth the Holy Spirit work in a ſupernatural way, without a Goſpel or Ordinances? Or if it did, doth it work, and not effect ſo much as the firſt element in Chriſtianity? I mean a ſenſe of the want of Grace? May the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit converſe in thoſe unclean places, where nothing appears but Error, Pride, Idolatry, Impiety, and Wickedneſs of all ſorts? It is not reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. If Nature could lift up it ſelf to a ſincere love of God, the Spirit and the Goſpel ſeem to be ſuperfluous thereunto. And as for <hi>habenti dabitur,</hi> it ſpeaks not to the point in hand, becauſe it ſpeaks not of the uſe of natural talents: not in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13, for there it is accommodated to the Parable of the ſeed, and given as an item to ſuch as heard the Goſpel; nor yet in the <hi>25th</hi> chap. for there the uſe of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents is remunerated with eternal life, <hi>ver.</hi> 21 &amp; 23; which is a Crown too rich to be ſet upon meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60626:139"/>There the talents upon abuſe are taken away; and by conſequence, if it were meant of naturals, the abuſers muſt loſe their reaſon, and become fools; which experience denies. But whatever the talents are in that promiſe, it muſt be interpreted <hi>in eodem genere:</hi> If of talents of Nature, it runs thus; He that uſeth naturals, ſhall have more of them. If of talents of Grace, thus: He that uſeth Supernaturals, ſhall have more of them. But to ſtretch this promiſe <hi>a genere ad genus,</hi> from naturals to ſupernaturals, as if Nature might <hi>per ſaltum</hi> be crowned with Grace, is an interpretation very incongruous, and directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>He hath called us, not according to our works, but according to his own grace.</hi> The end of this promiſe is to excite men to the good uſe of talents. But after ſuch an unreaſonable ſtretch of it, as makes Grace the reward of Nature, What can come of it? Where ſhall the fruit of it be? Not in the Church, there they have the Goſpel-grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; nor yet out of it, there it is not revealed: neither is it poſſible that thoſe who want the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ſhould be ſtirred up by any promiſe in it, to ſeek after it in the uſe of naturals. Thus we ſee, that the external call is not a debt to Nature, but a meer gift of Grace. Such as the great Gift is, ſuch is the Charter. The great gift of Chriſt was purely, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally gratuitous; therefore the Charter of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which in the manifeſtation of it is the external Call, is ſo alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Internal call is of Grace: And here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome oppoſe this call, I ſhall firſt ſhew, That there is ſuch a call, and then that it is meerly of Grace.</p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:60626:139"/>
               <p n="1">1. There is ſuch a thing as an internal call. <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> at leaſt in the firſt draught of his Hereſy, placed Grace only, <hi>in libero arbitrio &amp; doctrina,</hi> in Free-will and Doctrine; Free-will being Nature not Grace, Doctrine being Grace but not the all of it, he left no room at all for an Internal call, he allowed no Grace but that external one of Doctrine: and in this he ſpake very conſonantly to his other opinions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Original ſin as he did, What need could there be of internal Grace? There being no ſpot or ſinful defect in the Soul, Grace hath nothing to do within, all is well and whole there, and needs no Phyſitian; all is in order and harmony there, and nothing to be new-made or new-framed. Therefore St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that though <hi>Pelagius</hi> would ſometimes talk of a multiform and ineffable Grace; yet it was but to put a blind, and cover over his hereſy:<note place="margin">Quid juvat <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagium,</hi> quia diverſis verbis eandem rem dicit, ut non intelligatur in lege at<expan>
                        <am>

Dial. de juſt. fo. 13.</note> Still he meant no more than meer Doctrine, and external Grace; denying Original ſin, there was nothing within for Grace to do or rectify. <hi>Socinus,</hi> who with the <hi>Pelagians</hi> denies Original ſin, makes little or no account of internal Grace, though in his <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections</hi> he ſpeak of an <hi>interius anxilium,</hi> an inward aid; yet he ſaith, That Faith is generated, <hi>potiſſimum per externa,</hi> chiefly by externals; and again, That Faith is rather to be called Gods command than his gift. But that there is ſuch a thing as an Internal call, and that diſtinct from the external, I ſhall propoſe three or four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All in the Church have an external call; but ſome are not ſo much as illuminated, it is not given to them to know the heavenly myſteries. Thoſe by the way-ſide heard the word and underſtood it not;
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60626:140"/>Chriſt was a ſtumbling block to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs to the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and both becauſe he was not, though outwardly propoſed, inwardly underſtood. Chriſt the power of God, if underſtood, could not have been a ſtumbling block to the <hi>Jews</hi> who looked after ſigns; Chriſt the Wiſdom of God, if under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, could not have been fooliſhneſs to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who ſought after Wiſdom. Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> relates this Story: An Old Man, of above 60 years of Age, a conſtant hearer of the Word, was after all ſo groſly ignorant, as upon Diſcourſe to ſay, that God was a good old Man, Chriſt a towardly youth, the Soul a great bone in the body; and the happineſs of man after death, was to be put into a pleaſant green Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Such poor blind Souls have indeed an external call, but not ſo much as the firſt element of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal one; Illumination, which is the initial thing therein, is wanting in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All in the Church have an external call; but ſome are for their iniquity judicially hardned under the means: the Word of Life is to them the ſavour of death; Chriſt the Corner-ſtone a ſtumbling-block: the light blinds them, the melting ordinances harden them. Theſe men have an external call, but nothing of an internal one; it being impoſſible that the ſame perſons, under the ſame means, ſhould be illuminated and ſoftened, which are the effects of an internal call, and at the ſame time ſhould be blinded and hardened under the means, which cannot but have in them an external one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some under the Goſpel have a wonderful work wrought in them, their eyes are opened upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Myſteries, their wills are melted into the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60626:140"/>Divine Will. Gods Law is engraven in their heart; his image is the beauty and glory of their ſouls: A great work is done in them, a new-creation appears within; and how ſhould this be, or which way ſhould it be effected, but by that internal call which calls things that are not, as though they were, which in a glorious way calls Faith and other Graces into being? Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, That the Goſpel came to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> not in word only, but in power and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. Here's the true internal call; the word did not only outwardly ſound to them, no, it was inwardly engrafted to the ſaving of the ſoul; it was ſtrongly and ſweetly ſet home upon the heart, ſo as to produce Faith and Love. It was not in meer notions, but it ſprung up into a new-creature. This is the internal call. If a meer external one might have done it, <hi>Pelagius</hi> in the rudeſt draught of his Hereſie had been in the right. He placed Grace in meer Doctrine and Free-will; but to the framing of the new-creature, an internal ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is requiſite. Hence St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">De Praedeſt. l. 1. cap. 8.</note> That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have not only, as others, an outward Preacher, but an inward one: <hi>Intùs à patre audiunt,</hi> they hear and learn of the Father. He ſpeaks to them inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuch words of life and power as produces the new-creature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Miniſtry of Chriſt was a very excellent one: He ſpake, did, lived, as never man did; there were Oracles in his mouth, Miracles in his hands, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity in his life. Never was there ſuch an external call as here; yet would this do the work? Would this ſecure a Church or people to God? No; He tells them plainly, That except they were born of the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60626:141"/>Spirit, they could not enter Heaven. That no man can come to him except the Father draw him. There muſt be an internal traction, or elſe there would be never a believer in the world. <hi>Trahitur miris modis ut velit ab illo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auſt.</hi> ad Bon. lib. 1. cap. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>qui novit intus in ipſis hominum cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus operari;</hi> In this Traction there is a ſecret and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable touch upon the heart to make it believe and receive Chriſt: This is an internal call indeed. Yet, as pregnant as the words are, the <hi>Socinians</hi> have an art to turn Gods. Traction into Mans Diſpoſition; and the Divine energy, into human probity; <hi>Vis praecipua in audientium probitate conſiſtebat,</hi> the chief force con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the probity of the auditors.<note place="margin">Prael. Theol. cap. 12.</note> Thus <hi>Socinus</hi> touching that Traction. Thoſe who have probity of mind, who will do Gods Will; thoſe honeſt Souls will embrace the Goſpel. When God is ſaid to touch the heart, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.26, the meaning is, they had tangible hearts, ſuch as were inclinable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will;<note place="margin">De Vera Rel. l. 4. cap. 1.</note> ſo <hi>Volkelius,</hi> And again, when God draws men, he propoſes his Will; and the <hi>probi,</hi> the honeſt hearts are perſwaded:<note place="margin">De Ver. Rel. lib. 5. cap. 18.</note> ſo the ſame Author. Thus by an odd perverſe interpretation of Scripture, the choiceſt operations of Grace are at laſt reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into nature and freewill. This more plainly appears by that explication which <hi>Volkelius</hi> in the place firſt quoted, gives us of probity. There are (ſaith he) in Man three things, Reaſon, Will, and Appetite; if the Will, the middle faculty, apply it ſelf to Reaſon, there is probity; if to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, there is improbity. We ſee here what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity is, the meer product of the Will; Faith is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into probity, and probity into the Will of man: There is no need of Grace, at leaſt not of an
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60626:141"/>internal one. The probity requiſite to Faith, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe men much the ſame, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires from the auditors of morality, that is, that they act <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according to Reaſon:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eth.</hi> l. 1. c. 3.</note> Thus accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them there is nothing of Myſtery or Grace in this Traction, but only a following the common principles of nature; out of this temper Faith will ſpring up. But do theſe men believe Scripture? There the natural unregenerate man is thus deſcribed: He is dead in ſin, A corrupt tree which cannot bring forth good fruit, He perceives not ſpiritual things; His carnal mind is not ſubject to the Law, nor indeed can be; Without grace he cannot do good, no, nor ſo much as ſpend a thought about it; He is a ſtranger from the life of God, and blindneſs is upon his heart: and can there be any true probity in ſuch an one? The <hi>Corinthians,</hi> at leaſt ſome of them, were before their converſion, Fornicators, Idolaters, Adulterers, Effeminate, Abuſers of themſelves with Mankind, Thieves, Covetous, Drunkards, Revilers, Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, and 10. And what probity was in them? True probity, ſuch as is towards God, is no other than ſincerity; and ſincerity is not one Grace, but the rectitude of all. And may ſuch a thing go before Faith? Where true probity is, there is a pure intention to do Gods Will, and may it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecede that Faith, which is the ſingle eye, and works by love? Probity is not an off-ſpring of nature but of Grace; could Free-will elevate it ſelf to it, there would need no traction, no influence of Grace at all.<note n="*" place="margin">Qui humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati &amp; obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae humanae ſubjungunt gratiae adjuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, nec, ut obedientes &amp; humiles ſimus, ipſius gratiae donum eſſe conſentiunt, reſiſtunt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolo diceenti, quid habes, quod non ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepiſti?

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60626:142"/>gifts of Grace: To conclude, the Fathers Traction doth not ſtand in mans probity, but in a Divine ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, ſuch as produces faith in the heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The internal call is meerly of Grace. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit breathes where it liſts. God calls as he pleaſes: ſome are called according to purpoſe; all are not ſo. Every heart under the Evangelical means, is not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>Lydia</hi>'s was. God works in us to will and to do of his good pleaſure. If God be God, an infinite Mind, he muſt needs be free; if free in any thing, he muſt be ſo in acts of Grace, in his calling men home unto himſelf. It is true, that according to ſome, the Spirit is annexed to the Goſpel, and works equally on all the Auditors. But this opinion labours under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious conſequences; I mean, ſome ſuch as theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are. The Holy Spirit, whoſe prerogative it is to breathe where he liſt, and divide to every one as he will, is here affixed to his own organ the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and muſt part out his Grace equally to all: The Ordinance of Preaching, as if it were no longer a meer Ordinance, or pendant on the Spirit, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Grace, if not <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> yet in a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous way to all. The Miniſter, who uſes to look up for the ſpirit and excellency of power to ſucceed his labours, may reſt ſecure, all is ready and at hand. The peoples eyes, which ought to wait on the Lord, if peradventure he will give faith and repentance to them, will ſoon fall down and center on the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, where they are ſure without a peradventure to have their ſhare of Grace. Thoſe emphatical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which ſpeak of ſingular Grace to ſome, muſt now run in a much lower ſtrain. The opening of <hi>Lydia</hi>'s heart, how remarkable ſoever, muſt be no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60626:142"/>Grace, but common to the reſt. The tractions and inward teachings of the Father, which make ſome to come to Chriſt, muſt be general favours, and extendible to thoſe who come not to him. When the Apoſtle ſaith, That Chriſt <hi>is to the Jews a ſtumbling-block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs; but to them that are called, the power and wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23, 24, How ſignal ſoever the difference in the Text be, the internal call muſt be all one; in thoſe to whom Chriſt was a ſtumbling-block and fooliſhneſs, as in thoſe to whom he was the power and wiſdom of God. The called according to purpoſe, are called but as other men: Gods purpoſe is to call all a-like, mans only makes the difference. Theſe are the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of that opinion, and too heavy, I confeſs, for me to ſtand under. I reſt therefore in that of the Apoſtle, <hi>He hath called us, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. Here purpoſe and grace are joined together; if his purpoſe be free, if his grace be gratuitous, then he calls as he pleaſes. In calling men home to himſelf, he acts purely, totally from Grace. I conclude with that of <hi>Bonaventure, Hoc piarum mentium eſt, ut nihil ſibi tribuant, ſed totum Dei Gratiae;</hi> The genius of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minds, is to attribute nothing to themſelves, but all to Grace. Thus far touching the firſt thing, The freeneſs of Grace.</p>
               <p>The next thing propoſed, is the power and efficacy of Grace. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of an exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of power towards thoſe that believe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. So emphatical are the words there,<note place="margin">

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60626:143"/>his modeſty, can there deny a force and power ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Now touching the efficacy of Grace, I ſhall conſider three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its efficacy as to the Principle of Faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its efficacy as to actual believing and willing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its efficacy as to perſeverance in the faith.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing is its efficacy as to the Principle of Faith, and other Graces. By the Principle of Faith, I mean not the natural power of believing. God doth not command us to take down the Sun, for which we have no faculties; but to believe, for which we have an underſtanding and a will; no natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is wanting.<note place="margin">De Praed. c. 5.</note> Hence St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, the <hi>poſſe</hi> of believing, is of nature. This power in faln man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in conjunction with natural impotency, never arrives at the effect. The natural faculties are by the fall ſo vitiated, that though in a ſenſe he can, yet he will not believe. <hi>Trahit ſua quem<expan>

                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> voluptas,</hi> one luſt or other ſo attracts him, that he cannot <hi>a ſe impetrare ut velit,</hi> he cannot find in his heart to do it. He hath a kind of <hi>can</hi> in his natural faculties, but the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion blaſts the effect. Neither do I mean that power, which, as ſome Divines ſay, is ſupernatural, yet not an habit or vital principle of faith. Nature being fallen, Grace (ſay they) gives a ſecond power to ſet the will in <hi>aequilibrio;</hi> but that power doth not, as an habit, incline or diſpoſe a man to actual believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. This power, as I take it, is nothing but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Free-will. I ſee not how it ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from it. There are (as the Learned Doctor <hi>Twiſs</hi> hath obſerved) three things in the ſoul; that is, Powers, Habits, and Paſſions. Powers may be the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60626:143"/>ſubjects of Habits and Paſſions; but may a Power be the ſubject of a Power? A natural power of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural one? This looks like a Monſter. By the ſame reaſon Habits may be the ſubjects of Habits, and Paſſions of Paſſions. And is this power of believing, free or not? If free, then it is not ſupernatural; it may be a principle of not believing, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſupernatural can be. If not free, then it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the event, but to what? To not believing? then it is not ſupernatural. To believing? then all men (having, as theſe men ſay, the power) muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly believe, which Scripture and experience deny. I mean therefore ſuch a Principle of Faith, as is an habit and vital Principle; ſuch as is ſeminally and virtually faith; ſuch as hath the nature and eſſence of faith; ſuch as inclines and diſpoſes to actual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and before the act, denominates a man a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. When the act of faith comes forth into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is it from a believer, or from an unbeliever? If from a believer, then there was an habit of faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If from an unbeliever, how unnatural is it, and how croſs to the ſuavity of Providence? There muſt then be an act of faith, before a principle; a fruit, before a tree or ſeed. What ſhall we ſay of ſuch an one? He is a believer in act, but in principle none; as ſoon as the act ceaſes, he is not at all a believer. There muſt therefore be an habit, a vital principle of faith: This in the uſe of means is infuſed or created, and that by the power of grace. To clear this, I ſhall lay down two or three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Principle of Faith and other Graces, is not produced by meer ſuaſion, by a meer propoſal of the Evangelical object. In converſion there is a great
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60626:144"/>work wrought within; the deadly wound of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal corruption muſt be healed, the new creature muſt be ſet up in us; and can ſuaſion do this? Such a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work muſt be done by an efficient cauſe, not by a meer allicient one, ſuch as ſuaſion is. A natural man is blind, nay dead in ſpiritual things; and what ſuaſion can make the blind to ſee, or the dead to riſe? Suaſion is ſo far from giving a faculty, that it preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it. The uſe of it is not to confer a power, but to excite and ſtir it up into act. Satan uſes ſuaſion to ſubvert the ſouls of men; and doth God do no more to convert them unto himſelf? How then ſhould he ever gather a Church to himſelf? Satans ſuaſions run with the tide and ſtream of corrupt nature; but Gods are againſt it; and in all reaſon the balance will be caſt rather on that ſide which hath Natures vote and free concurrence, than on that which hath Natures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy and contradiction. In this work there is more than meer ſuaſion. God is not a meer Orator, but an admirable Operator; his word is not ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive only, but factive, commanding thoſe Divine Principles into being, <hi>vox imperativa abit in operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam;</hi> he calls for a new heart, and it is ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This holy Principle is not produced by aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Grace, as if a natural man did by Divine aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance work it in himſelf. The Principle or power of believing, is either natural or ſupernatural; if natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it is by creation; if ſupernatural, it is by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or inſpiration; neither way is it produced in a way of aſſiſtance. An aſſiſtance is not accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a thing to produce a new power, but to bring forth an act from thence. The light is aſſiſtent to the eye in the act of viſion, but it gives not the viſive
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:60626:144"/>power to it; aſſiſting grace concurs to the act of believing, but it confers not a believing principle. The greateſt Saint in the world ſtands in need of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting grace, that his gracious principles may come into actual exerciſe; he muſt have help from the holy one, a ſupply of the Spirit of Chriſt; the Heavenly roots do not caſt forth themſelves unleſs God be as dew to them; the ſweet ſpices do not flow out actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, unleſs God breath upon them by auxiliary grace; ſtill he wants aſſiſtance to the doing of good as he ought; the greateſt Saint, though a man full of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine principles, ſtands in need of aſſiſtance. And doth a natural man, one void of good, fraught with evil, need no more? Is regenerating quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, renewing, new-creating grace, nothing but an aſſiſtance only? May any one believe that the holy Spirit in Scripture ſhould give ſuch high ſtately titles to an aſſiſtance only? May a man be a co-operator, or co-partner with God in the raiſing up faith and a new creature in himſelf? It's true, a natural man may by a common grace enter upon preparatories; he may attend upon the means, but what can he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the work it ſelf? he is meerly natural, the new creature is totally ſupernatural, and what can he do towards it? could he contribute ought, what would the new creature be? muſt it not be part na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural as from man, part ſupernatural as from God; part old as from nature, part new as from grace? Thus it muſt be if this great work be divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man. Notable is that of <hi>Lactantius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De fal. Rel. Lib. 1. Cap. 11.</note>

               <p n="3">3. The holy principles of Grace are produced by an act of Divine power: God lays the foundations of faith and the new creature, as it were in mighty wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in the very ſame heart in which there is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and torrent of corruption; and no power leſs than the Divine can put back the ſtream of nature, and ſet up the Heavenly ſtructure of Grace in ſuch an heart. The production of gracious principles is in Scripture ſet forth in glorious titles, ſuch as do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port power; 'tis called a <hi>Tranſtation,</hi> Col. 1.13. it tranſplants and carries us away out of a ſtate of ſin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60626:145"/>a ſtate of grace. 'Tis a <hi>Generation,</hi> Jam. 1.18. it begets us to a participation of the Divine Nature. 'Tis a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> Epheſ. 2.5. It quickens us and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires into us a Supernatural life, of which the fall had left no ſpark or relick at all. 'Tis a <hi>Creation,</hi> Eph. 2.10. it raiſes up a new creature out of nothing, and gives us a ſpiritual being, which before we had not; and if theſe things do not ſpeak power, nothing can. Hence the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Goſpel coming in power, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. Nay, that in the ſucceſs of it there is an excellency of power, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. and an exceeding greatneſs of power towards Believers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. The work of faith is ſaid to be fulfilled with power, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. How much more muſt it be an act of power to lay the Primordials and firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of faith in a fallen unbelieving creature? When there was nothing appearing in our lapſed nature, but a <hi>vacuum,</hi> a chaos of ſin, a ſpiritual death and nullity, only the Divine power was able to repair the ruins of the fall, and rear up the Heavenly life and nature in us. This great truth was notably ſet forth in the conception of our Saviour Chriſt; it was not in the courſe of nature, his Mother knew not a man, but <hi>the Holy Ghoſt came upon her; the power of the higheſt overſhadowed her, that the holy thing might be born of her,</hi> Luk. 1.35. In like manner when Chriſt is formed in the heart, when the new-creature is ſet up in us, it is not in the way of nature; we know not the humane power in this work, here is no leſs than <hi>dextra excelſi,</hi> the right hand of the moſt High to effect it; here are <hi>veſtigia ſpiritus ſancti,</hi> the footſteps of the holy Spirit to bring it to paſs: the ſame power and ſpirit which formed Chriſt in the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:60626:146"/>womb, formes him in the heart: as in his participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the humane nature there was a Supernatural operation, ſo is there in our participation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. This is the firſt efficacy of Grace, it new creates the heart, and imprints the Divine image there; it inſpires holy Principles, and ſo lays a foundation for obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an efficacy of Grace as to actual believing and willing. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> asks the queſtion, <hi>Quid agit liberum arbitrium?</hi> What doth Free-will do? and then anſwers,<note place="margin">De Lib. Arbit. &amp; Grat.</note> 
                  <hi>Salvatur,</hi> it is ſaved. And <hi>Agatho</hi> in his Epiſtle lays down this as a rule, <hi>Quod a Chriſto non ſuſceptum eſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6. Gen. Conc. Act. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>nec ſalvatum eſt, ſi ab eo humana vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas ſuſcepta eſt, &amp; ſalvata eſt;</hi> That which was not aſſumed by Chriſt, is not ſaved by him. If an humane will was aſſumed, then it is ſaved; and it is ſaved, firſt in that principles of holy rectitude are inſtilled into it, and then in that thoſe principles are drawn forth in actual willing: both theſe are neceſſary, the firſt implants the vital principles of Grace in the heart, the ſecond makes them bloſſom and bring forth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fruit; without thoſe vital principles the will, however aſſiſted <hi>ab extra,</hi> is internally in it ſelf but a faculty meerly natural and void of ſpiritual life; it hath no proportion to the vital ſupernatural acts of Faith and Love. Neither is it poſſible, that any ſuch ſhould iſſue out from thence, no, not by any extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal aſſiſtance whatſoever: an act if vital and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, muſt be from an internal principle that is ſuch. Again, unleſs thoſe vital principles bring forth actual believing and willing, they muſt needs lie dead, and come to nothing. And yet if we eſtimate things according to their worth and excellency, we cannot but think it much more eaſie and eligible for the wiſe
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60626:146"/>and good God to ſuffer an abortion in all the ſeeds and principles of nature, than in thoſe precious and admirable ones of Grace, which do not, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do, carry the meer footſteps, but the very image and reſemblance of his holy nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pelagius</hi> would at leaſt in ſome ſenſe own, that the <hi>poſſe,</hi> the meer power of believing, is from God; but he would not have the <hi>velle,</hi> the actual willing and believing, to be ſo. He ſaith, that God worketh all things; that is, he gives to them the operative power. He diſtinguiſhes three things, <hi>Poſſe, Velle, Eſſe; Poſſe in natura, Velle in arbitrio, Eſſe in effectu:</hi> Power,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auſt.</hi> de Grat. Chriſt. cap. 4.</note> Willing, Being: Power is in nature, Willing in the free faculty, Being in the effect. The Power, ſaith he, is properly from God; but the other two are from our ſelves, as deſcending <hi>de arbitrii fonte,</hi> from the fountain of Free-will. Hence St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells him, That according to his opinion, which attributed to Grace not willing or believing, but a power only, he could not be a true Chriſtian. A power of believing (whether it be as <hi>Pelagius</hi> would have it,<note place="margin">De Grat. Chriſti, c. 10.</note> a meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked power, and no more; or whether it be ſuch a power as is an habit or vital principle of Grace,) is not all that Grace operates; a meer naked power is not all. To entertain ſuch a thought, is highly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparage Grace. A power of believing is from God; and is not a power of ſinning, ſo too? If Free-will, which includes in it a power of ſinning, be a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it muſt be ſo. If a power of ſinning be from God, and no more but a meer power of believing be from him, then how is God the author of actual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, more than of actual ſinning? <hi>Pelagius</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That God is ſaid to operate all things, becauſe
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60626:147"/>he gives the operative power; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> from thence infers this juſt conſequence, That then God operates all ſin,<note place="margin">De Grat. &amp; Lib. Ar. lib. 4. cap. 4.</note> becauſe he gave a Free-will, by which all ſin is wrought: Therefore if God be not the author of actual ſin, as he is not, nor cannot be; then neither is he author of actual believing, by giving a power to believe. Both powers are from God; and how hard a thing, and how contumelious to Grace is it to ſay, That he produces as much towards ſinning, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards believing? And yet we muſt ſay ſo, if there be no more than a meer power to both. Neither is ſuch a power, as is a habit or vital principle of Grace, all that Grace operates; thoſe precious Seeds and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, were never let down from Heaven to ſleep and lye hid in the root, but to ſpring up in actual Graces ſutable and congruous thereunto. There is a Divine vigor in thoſe Principles; and when auxiliary Grace ſtirs them up, and becomes an heavenly dew unto them, they will ſpring up as a well of living water, and ſhoot forth as the ſeed of God. There is a ſpecial Providence watching over theſe; to make them come up in a crop of holy fruits.</p>
               <p>Some Divines expreſs themſelves thus: Grace gives a ſupernatural power, and ſo puts the will in <hi>aequili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio,</hi> in an even balance, that it may believe or not believe, as it pleaſeth. But what a thing is this? An <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or indifferency towards ſuch a precious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as Chriſt is, looks very ill, and like a ſin; and how ſhould. it come from Grace? If Grace work only a kind of indifferency, it doth far leſs than meer Moral virtue doth: Moral virtue is, as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſpeaks, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an habit of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to right reaſon; it earries in it a
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60626:147"/>promptitude and inclination to virtuous actions; it renders them eaſie, and in a ſort natural: and may we, can we, ſuppoſe that Grace, a Principle much more ſublime, and of far higher extraction, ſhould only put the ſoul into an aequilibrious ſtate, no more propending to good than evil? If Grace operate only a kind of indifferency, then the comfort of Chriſtians is departed; they are afraid of nothing more than of themſelves; the vanity and corruption in their own hearts is terrible to them: yet in this caſe the greateſt of fears, I mean, to be left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, falls upon them. They are not to look up to God to fix their hearts upon himſelf; no, nor ſo much as to incline them that way; their life muſt not be a life of faith or dependence upon God the fountain of Grace; there is no warrant for ſuch a thing; Grace only works a ſtate of indifferency, and then leaves the Will to do the reſt: if they will depend upon any thing, it muſt be upon their own Will, that is, upon Vanity; nothing elſe determines the great concern of their ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Now here I ſhall firſt prove, That Grace works the actual willing and believing; and then, That it doth it in a way of power.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Grace works the actual willing and believing: And here I ſhall lay down ſeveral things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture is very pregnant. <hi>God worketh to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2.13, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he worketh efficaciouſly, not a meer power of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but the very willing: Neither doth he work the willing conditionally, if we will; for then the willing ſhould be a condition to it ſelf, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and ſhould be before he work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it, which is
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60626:148"/>directly oppoſite to the Text; but he works it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely of his own good pleaſure. His work doth not depend on mans conſent, but it cauſeth it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he work it ſo, as that man in whom he worketh the willing, might actually not will: for a man who wills, muſt needs will; and a man in whom he works the willing, muſt needs do ſo. If a man do not will, then God doth not work the willing; for a willing which is not, is not wrought: in this caſe nothing is wrought but the power of willing, which ſatisfies not the Text. If the man in whom he works, do will, the thing is infallible; for a man cannot will and nill both at once: but he worketh the willing ſo, as that mans willing doth certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it. Neither doth he work the willing as a partial concauſe, for then he ſhould be a cauſe only <hi>ex parte,</hi> and do but ſomething towards it, the reſt muſt be not from him, but only from mans will as the author of it; which is to aſcribe to mans will, not a merit only, but a kind of Deity, as if it were the ſole author of ſome ſupernatural good. But he works the willing as a total ſupreme cauſe; he cauſeth man to will: Mans will doth not co-operate, but ſubope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate under the ſweet power of Grace, moving it to will. It is true, man willeth, but it is cauſally from Grace that he doth ſo. Mans will is the <hi>principium quod</hi> which produces the willing; but Gods Grace is the <hi>principium quo</hi> which cauſeth it. Hence St. <hi>Auſtin, Nos nolumus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De dono per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever. cap. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>ſed Deus in nobis operatur &amp; velle; nos operamur, ſed Deus in nobis operatur &amp; ipſum operari pro bona voluntate:</hi> We will and work, but God works both in us. And afterwards the ſame Father adds, <hi>Hoc eſt pium, hoc verum, ut ſit humilis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſio
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60626:148"/>ut detur totum Deo:</hi> This is pious and true, that there may be an humble confeſſion, and the whole may be aſcribed to God. Again, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, that Faith is not of our ſelves, but the gift of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8; that the very actual belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is freely given to us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. We ſee here, Faith is a meer gift, it is not from our ſelves, but from God; And what can be more emphatical? It is not ſaid that Faith is offered, but given; external things, which exiſt before they are given and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may be ſaid to be offered; but Faith which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts not before it be given and received, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be offered. A Faith, which is not given and received, is a <hi>non</hi>-entity; and a <hi>non</hi>-enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not a gift. Faith is Gods gift, not where it is not, but where it is. That cannot be properly ſaid to be given, which is not received. Giving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving relate mutually each to other; therefore when Grace gives Faith, it gives the very reception, it cauſes a man to believe; and when it cauſes a man to believe, he doth infallibly do ſo; and if he do not do ſo, the gift is not a gift of Faith which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of; but of a power only to believe, which anſwers not to the Text. Hence it appears, That actual believing is meerly from Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God only give a power of believing, and that in common to all, the actual believer makes himſelf to differ from others. God gave him only the common Grace, but the improvement of it is from himſelf; God gave him only a power, but the act (which hath more of actuality, and ſo of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God, and indeed is the very end and center
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60626:149"/>of the power) is from himſelf. Man may now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in himſelf, as contributing of his own, that which is perfective of that power, which is from God. After Grace hath done its utmoſt, Mans Will is made the umpire, whether the operations of Grace, ſhall be ſomething or nothing: God made the heart, and the wheels therein; but the motion is mans own, he only muſt determine this great concern. Grace begins to build the new creature, but man muſt finiſh the work, or elſe it can never be done. Grace fets the Will in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> and that's all it; muſt move no further, but leave the event to the lottery of mans Will. Thus God is debaſed, and man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted; Free-grace is dethroned, and Free-will is crowned: But if we, as we ought, muſt glory in the Lord; if we have nothing but what we have received, then we muſt confeſs, that the actual wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and believing is from Grace: acknowledging with St. <hi>Cyprian, In nullo gloriandum, quando noſtrum nihil eſt.</hi>

                  <hi>irriſeria petitie,</hi> a kind of mock-devotion: There can hardly be a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable vanity than this, To beg of God, that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60626:149"/>which is not within the line of Grace to beſtow; which is wholly turned over to the power and will of man to effect. We may here ſay with <hi>Seneca, Quid votis opus eſt?</hi> What need any prayers for that which we may have from our ſelves? If the thing be not from God but from our ſelves, we do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed pray, but diſſemble a prayer; we make as if the thing were a gift of God, when there is no ſuch matter. The Philoſopher (ſaith <hi>Epictetus</hi>) expects all <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from himſelf, and ſo may the Chriſtian too in the point of willing and believing; if theſe be not Grace, he need not look up to God for them. Again, for what do the Saints praiſe God? Is it not for touching and opening their hearts to Chriſt, for making them willing in the day of his power? Is it not for putting his ſpirit within them, and cauſing them to walk in his ſtatutes? What can be more due to God, more proper for a Saint than this? Hence they glorified God in the repenting Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18. And again, they glorified God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1.24. When <hi>David</hi> and his people offered willingly to God, he falls into an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extaſie, <hi>Who am I, and what is my people,</hi> 1 Chr. 29.14? All things, ſaith he, are of thee, not only our gold and our ſilver, not only our hearts and wills, but our very actual willingneſs alſo; yet if the willing and believing be not of Grace, all theſe are but mockeries and falſe Hallelujahs: They who glorifie God in Converts, offer but a blind ſacrifice, and glorify but an Idol of their own fancy. If God do not do the thing, Why ſhould we praiſe him for it? How can we do ſo in truth, when the matter
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60626:150"/>will not bear it? Indeed we do but diſſemble a praiſe, making as if he were the author of that which is not from him. Thus we ſee, that willing and believing muſt be from Grace, or elſe we utterly evacuate thoſe prayers and praiſes which are offered up to God touching the ſame. Thus much touching the firſt thing, That Grace works the willing and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Grace works it in a way of power. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the ſucceſs of the Goſpel, ſaith, <hi>That the excellency of the power is of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.7. And again, he prays for the <hi>Theſſalonians, That God would fulfil the work of faith with power,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.11. If faith be fulfilled, as it is, by the acts of it, then thoſe acts are produced by the power of Grace: Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are willing in the day of his power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. When the Diſciples wonder'd how a Camel ſhould go through a Needles eye, how a rich man ſhould be ſaved; our Saviour ſolves the knot by the power of God, <hi>With him all things are poſſible,</hi> Luk. 18.27. The power of Grace can fetch off the World, the Camels<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunch, from the heart, and make it paſs (as it were) through the Needles eye into Heaven. It's true, man wills, man believes, but it is from the ſtrong and ſweet gales of Grace that he doth ſo. The willing and believing are voluntary acts in regard of mans will, but acts of power in regard of Gods Spirit, which touches and moves the heart thereunto. It may be thought by ſome, that there needs no expence of power towards willing and believing; that a power of willing and believing is enough for us. But ſhould God give us only a power to will and believe, and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60626:150"/>leave the reſt to our will, we have great reaſon to think that we ſhould all do, as innocent <hi>Adam</hi> did, fall from God, and never reduce that power into act. The Divine Principles in <hi>Adam</hi> were pure and without mixture; but the power of believing and willing in us, hath in the ſame heart where it dwells, an Inmate of corruption, which continually counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works it. In innocency the temptation ſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, a-courting the ſenſes; but after the fall it makes nearer approaches, as having a party within ready to open and betray every faculty. To me it looks like a proud thought for any to imagine, that under ſuch a diſparity he could act his part better than <hi>Adam</hi> did. If then the foundation of God muſt ſtand, if the election muſt obtain, if Chriſt muſt have a ſeed, if the Spirit muſt have a temple, it is no leſs than neceſſary, that the power of Grace ſhould ſecure that willing and believing, without which thoſe high and great deſigns of Heaven cannot take effect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is an efficacy of Grace as to perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Faith and Holineſs. Perſeverance, wherever it is, is from Grace. The inherent Graces in the Saints are but creatures; no creature, no, not the moſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, doth or can preſerve it ſelf. All depend upon their Original in their being and duration; hence, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> obſerves, God is always a-working,<note place="margin">Ad Cteſiph. cap. 3.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a-giving; <hi>Non mihi ſufficit,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>quod ſemel donavit, niſi ſemper donaverit:</hi> It is not enough for me, that he once give, unleſs he always do ſo. Hence that of St. <hi>Auſtin, Non ita ſe debet homo ad Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num convertere, ut, cum ab eo fact us fuerit juſtus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Gen. ad. Lit. lib. 8.12.</note> 
                  <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcedat, ſed it a ut ab illo ſemper ſiat:</hi> Man ought not
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60626:151"/>to convert to God, that being made juſt he might depart from him; but that he might be always made juſt by him. The Phyſician heals and departs, but God doth not do ſo; he is ſtill a-healing and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making us by the continual ſpirations of his Spirit and Grace, that we may perſevere unto the end. Were not perſeverance from Grace, there could be no ſuch thing as a life of Faith; it would be utterly needleſs to hang upon Promiſes, or to look up for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Grace, or with <hi>David</hi> to pray that God would keep the good frame in the heart, or hold up our goings in his paths. Perſeverance being from our ſelves, we may center and ſafely lye down there. We may ſay as <hi>Laodicea,</hi> We are rich, and have need of nothing, no, not of God the Fountain of Grace. We may do what St. <hi>Jerom</hi> charges on the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Ad Cteſ. cap. 3.</note> bid God depart, he is no more neceſſary to us. It's true, he gave us a ſtock of power and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will; but now we can ſtand upon our own bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, all is in our own hand, there is no room for a life of faith, no, nor for any true gratitude for our ſtanding in Grace.<note place="margin">De Civ. lib. 12. cap. 9.</note> It is St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> obſervation, That the Angels who ſtood, were <hi>amplius adjuti,</hi> more helped than thoſe who fell; therefore they caſt down their Crowns before God, aſcribing their ſtanding, not to themſelves, but to Grace. Should they do, what they cannot do, aſcribe it to themſelves, they could not be thankful. In like manner holy men who perſevere, attribute nothing to themſelves, but all to Grace;<note place="margin">Ad Cteſ. cap. 3</note> 
                  <hi>Quodcun<expan>

                     </expan> in ſuo rivulo fluit,</hi> as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>ad fontem refert,</hi> Whatever flows in his rivulet, he refers to the great fountain; that he faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60626:151"/>and lapſes, is of his own; that he ſtands and perſeveres, is of Grace. Were it not ſo, the praiſe and glory ſhould be aſcribed not to God, but to our ſelves, which would be to turn Gratitude into Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
               <p>The Graces of the Saints may be conſidered in the act, or in the habit. The acts have their too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent pauſes and interruptions; but the habit, the vital principle, is a ſeed of immortality, and never dyes. In the ſaddeſt falls of a Saint, it may be ſaid of him as it was of <hi>Eutychus, His life is in him. He that is born of God, doth not commit ſin;</hi> nay, he cannot ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. Doubtleſs he can ſin ſins of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nay, and groſs ſins too, as appears in the falls of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> but he cannot ſin ſo as totally to unframe the new-creature, and lay himſelf in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſtate. This is clear by the reaſons in the Text, <hi>For his ſeed remaineth in him, and he is born of God.</hi> Could he by ſin extinguiſh the very principles of Grace, he might ſin to all intents and purpoſes, contrary to the expreſs letter of the text; nay, and his ſeed might not remain, and he might ceafe to be born of God, contrary to the reaſons in the text. If the Divine ſeed and birth do not preſerve him from regnant ſin, ſuch as would overthrow him, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves him from no ſin at all; the text and reaſon are altogether inſignificant. But if, as the text and truth is, it preſerves him from regnant ſin, then the Divine Principles are not extinguiſhed when he falls into ſin.</p>
               <p>The habits of Grace may be conſidered meerly in themſelves, or in their dependence. In themſelves
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60626:152"/>they are but defectible creatures, and might total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fail; their being is not from themſelves, no more is their duration; in their dependance they cannot poſſibly fail, becauſe they are ſupported by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what greater than themſelves. Remarkable is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the caſe of <hi>Adam</hi> and that of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; in <hi>Adam,</hi> one act of ſin expelled perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo that upon the fall, there was not left in him ſo much as the leaſt relick of ſanctity, or ſpark of ſpiritual life: he, and after him, all his poſterity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſpiritually dead in ſin, not in part only; for then the new-creature ſhould be new but in part; but totally, every thing in fallen man wants quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening. But in believers, not one, not many ſins are able to drive out the principles of Grace, though thoſe principles are imperfect in themſelves, and dwell together with much inherent corruption, yet are they not driven out: and the reaſon of this difference is, <hi>Adam</hi> had the ſtock of holineſs in his own hands; but the graces of the believers depend upon ſomewhat greater than themſelves. Now touching this Dependence, I ſhall lay down three or four things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Graces of Saints depend upon Election; though Election be in it ſelf from all eternity, yet it buds and bloſſoms in time. He <hi>hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt: According as he hath choſen us in him, Eph.</hi> 1.3, 4. Divine Graces, which are choice ſpiritual bleſſings, iſſue not out of common providence; but, as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>ex abyſſo aeternitatis,</hi> out of the great fountain of Election: The eternal Love, which
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:60626:152"/>lay in Gods boſom, comes forth in the production of thoſe Graces: Nay, and in the duration of them, God fulfills all the good pleaſure of his goodneſs, and the work of Faith with power, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called; whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified,</hi> Rom. 8.30. We ſee clearly, Predeſtination carries them through the other links unto glory. It is obſervable, that when God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes his freſh mercies to his people, he doth it thus, <hi>I will yet chuſe Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 14.1. God gives ſuch ſupplies of Grace to his Saints, to make them perſevere, That it is, as if he choſe them again; When the Saints are drooping and dying, as it were, away, electing love gives them another viſit, and makes them live; when their love cools and ſlacks, his love is ever the ſame, and inflames theirs afreſh; And how ſhould their Graces fail? <hi>The purpoſe of God according to election doth ſtand,</hi> Rom. 9.11. <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. And how ſhould the rivulets or ſuperſtructures of Grace fail? They can no more do it than the great deſign of a Church can; their lamp never goes out, their ſeed never dies, the falſe Chriſts and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets cannot ſeduce them, <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.22. The Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> cannot eat into them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. Election, which is the fontal love, ſtill gives a freſh ſupply of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their Graces depend upon Chriſts merit and interceſſion. Chriſt prays for <hi>Peter,</hi> that his Faith may not fail, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32; neither doth it concern <hi>Peter</hi> only. In his ſolemn praier on earth, which was
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60626:153"/>the Canon and pattern of his interceſſion in Heaven, he prays to his Father for all believers thus, <hi>keep them from evil, Joh.</hi> 17.15. If they are kept from evil, they do not fall away, which is the greateſt of evils; if they are not kept from evil, Chriſts interceſſion ceaſes, or becomes powerleſs, neither of which can be; ceaſe it cannot, becauſe he ever lives to make interceſſion; become powerleſs it cannot, becauſe he is a Prieſt after the power of an endleſs life: what he intercedes for muſt be done. And this is yet the ſtronger, if we conſider for whom he thus intercedes, It is for believers, parts and pieces of his Myſtical body, ſuch as he cannot tell how to part from. Notable is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>The God of peace, who brought again from the dead the Lord Jeſus, make you perfect,</hi> Heb. 13.20, 21. That God who would loſe nothing of Chriſts human nature, no, not in the Grave, will perfect believers as myſtical parts of him, not ſuffering their Graces to ſee corruption in an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter decay; nor leaving their ſouls in the hell of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy: This is another foundation of perſeverance. Hence Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> ſaith;<note place="margin">De juſt. hab. 226.</note> 
                  <hi>Amor Dei in renatos non fundatur in illorum perfectione aut omnimodâ puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, ſed in Chriſio Mediatore:</hi> The love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the regenerate, is not founded in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or abſolute purity, but in Chriſt the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: As long as he intercedes, their Graces fail not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their Graces depend upon the holy Spirit, and that upon a double account: the one is this, The Spirit dwells in believers, it is an abiding Unction, ſuch as abides with them for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. It is as a Well of water ſpringing up to everlaſting life,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60626:153"/>
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. Continual irrigations of Grace iſſue from it to cheriſh the heavenly nature in them: The Holy Spirit will enliven them, as being parts of Chriſt. Hence our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo,</hi> Joh. 14.19. As long as the Spirit of life is upon the head, it will flow down upon the members; and whilſt it is there, there can be no ſuch thing as Apoſtacy, but on the contrary a ſweet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to all the holy ways of God. The other is this, The Spirit witneſſes to believers, at leaſt to ſome of them, That they are the Children of God, and by conſequence heirs of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16, 17. And how high an evidence is this? May ſuch a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony fail or be reverſed? Or may believers ceaſe to be children, and fall ſhort of the inheritance? Far be it from that holy Spirit. The Apoſtle calls the Spirit, the earneſt of our inheritance, not for a time, but till the redemption of the Church be compleated, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. till the whole ſum be paid in glory: the earneſt goes along with the believer to Heaven, his Graces therefore cannot fail by the way: This is another ground of perſeverance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their Graces depend upon the promiſes: In the Covenant of works there was no promiſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance; but in the Covenant of Grace there are many ſuch: <hi>God ſhall confirm you unto the end,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.8. <hi>He will put his fear in your hearts, that ye ſhall not depart from him,</hi> Jer. 32.40. <hi>He which did begin the good work in them, will perform it till the day of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.6. <hi>He will put his ſpirit into them, and canſe them to walk in his ſtatutes,</hi> Ezek. 36.27. In ſuch promiſes as theſe, the believers ſtate of Grace
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60626:154"/>is ſecured: Shall we now ſay, that all theſe promiſes are conditional, If we will perſevere, or, which is all one, do our duty? Is not this to turn the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace into that of Works? Is it not to evacuate all theſe promiſes touching perſeverance, as if God ſpoke in ſuch contradictory terms as theſe, If you perſevere, I will make you perſevere; as if perſeverance could be the condition of it ſelf? After theſe promiſes, the believers are but where they were before. Without theſe promiſes it would have been true, That if they perſevere, they do ſo; and with them ſo interpreted, what have they more? What do they contribute to believers, when the main ſtreſs of perſeverance is laid on mans will, and not on Gods grace. Theſe promiſes were penned to be great comforts to believers, that God would eſtabliſh them by his grace: but what comfort can they take in them, if the matter be left to their own lubricous will? It is in effect as if God ſhould ſay, I will preſerve you from all evils and dangers, only for that greateſt evil of all which is in your own hearts and wills, I will not undertake. What is this but to take away the ſpirit and life of the promiſes, to leave the Saints in a dead and comfortleſs condition? Our Saviour tells us to our comfort, <hi>That his ſheep ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of his hand,</hi> Joh. 10.28: not unleſs they themſelves will,<note place="margin">Prael. Theol. cap. 12.</note> ſaith <hi>Socinus:</hi> but what is this but to nullifie the promiſe? They cannot poſſibly be plucked out of Chriſts hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own voluntary conſent. So the promiſe runs thus: They ſhall not be plucked out of his hand but only in ſuch a way as the ſame is poſſible to be
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60626:154"/>done: that is, the words are abſurd, and ſignifie juſt nothing. But if the promiſes made to Saints, were thus conditional, what are thoſe made to Chriſt? Hath not God ſaid, That Chriſt ſhould have a ſeed, nay, and be ſatisfied in it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11? Hath he not ſaid, nay, ſworn to Chriſt, <hi>That his ſeed</hi> (ſuch as believers are) <hi>ſhould endure for ever; that his throne</hi> (a chief part of which is in their hearts) <hi>ſhould be as the Sun,</hi> Pſal. 89.35, 36? And are theſe promiſes conditional alſo? It's true, that there was a condition on Chriſts part, That he ſhould obey and ſuffer for us: but was there any on ours? Muſt theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes run thus, Chriſt ſhall have a ſeed and a throne if man will? No, the promiſes are abſolute; no mention at all is made of mans will. But if the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Saints may fail, ſo may theſe promiſes alſo. Chriſt might have no ſeed, at leaſt no enduring one, ſuch as may ſatisfie him. His throne, at leaſt that choice part of it which is in the hearts of the Saints, may utterly fail and come to nothing. If the matter be left to the Lottery of mans will, How is God true to his Son Chriſt? Poſſibly there might be no feed of new-creatures at all; or if there were, they might flie away from the birth in an utter apoſtacy. Nay, what if the event did hit right, and anſwer the promiſe, yet God is never the truer for that; neither can we ſay, that he fulfilled his promiſe in that event, which was never ſecured by his grace, but came to paſs as it happened by the lucky hit of mans will. To conclude, Upon the whole matter it appears God hath taken believers into his own hand; their Graces ſhall not fail, becauſe his Truth and Faithfulneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not;
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60626:155"/>their ſtanding is ſure, becauſe his promiſes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>To add no more: We ſee here how we ought in all humility to give Grace its due; and this we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, unleſs we give it all. <hi>Non eſt devotionis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſe prope totum Deo, ſed frandis retinuiſſe vel mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Proſper:</hi> To give Nine hundred ninety nine parts to Grace, and reſerve one only to mans will, is more than true devotion will bear: it's juſt to give the whole unto God. The <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins</hi> ſay, That he who receives any good thing in this world without a benediction, is a robber of God: but the greateſt ſacriledg of all is, when we own not the Grace of God in ſupernatural bleſſings which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the world to come; <hi>Verè humiles totum Deo reddunt,</hi> True humble ſouls render all to God. Let us then acknowledg with <hi>Jacob, We are leſs than the leaſt of all his mercies.</hi> We were naturally undone, unclean creatures, proper objects of wrath. Why did God ſend his Son in the fleſh to ſeek that which was loſt, waſh us in a laver of his own blood, and bring us into favour with him? We might have been born in the dark places of the earth where Chriſt is not named, where the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhines not in Pardons and Graces. Why did God place us in a Region of Evangelical light, and ſet Jeſus Chriſt with all his beauties and treaſures evidently before us? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel there are many blind eyes and hard hearts, many poor ſouls dead and buried in a grave of ſin. Why did he open our eyes upon heavenly my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and melt our hearts into the Divine will? Why did he raiſe us up out of our ſpiritual graves,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60626:155"/>and quicken us unto a Divine life? There is ſtill cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption within, and temptation without us. Our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are weak, and in themſelves defectible creatures. Why doth he ſupply us with freſh influences of grace, and maintain the new-creature in us? Why are we not ſwallowed up in temptations and corruptions, but kept and preſerved to the heavenly Kingdom? Here we muſt glory in our God, and cry out, Grace, Grace. All the good we have, is from that Fountain. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribes all to Grace; <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me. I labour, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges no I-neſs, but aſcribes all his ſpiritual being and working to Grace. I will ſhut up all with that of <hi>Bonaventure, Furti reus eſt, qui ſibi aliquid reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, cum Deus dicat, gloriam meam alteri non dabo;</hi> He is guilty of Theft, who retains any thing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when God hath ſaid, <hi>My glory I will not give to another. All glory therefore be to him alone.</hi>

A double imputation: One to the proper Agent, another to thoſe in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; the Conjunctions between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and us; how <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs is imputed to us; that it is not only the Meritorious, but Material cauſe of our Juſtification; this is proved from that phraſe, <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God;</hi> from the nature of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; from the parallel of the two <hi>Adams;</hi> from other phraſes in Scripture; from a pardon as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame with Juſtification; from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in our ſtead; the Objections againſt imputed Righteouſneſs anſwered; what juſtifies us as to the Goſpel terms; the Neceſſity and connexion of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Righteouſneſs; how we are juſtified by Faith; how Good Works are neceſſary. A ſhort Concluſion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THERE remaineth yet behind one Eminent piece of Grace; I mean Juſtification; this in <hi>Luther</hi> is, <hi>Articulus ſtantis &amp; cadentis Eccleſiae,</hi> and in <hi>Chemnitius, Arx &amp; propugnaculum Religionis Chriſtianae;</hi> a Sacred thing it is, and difficult to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; the true meaſures of it cannot be taken from any thing but the holy Scripture, where this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery is revealed. Touching Juſtification there are three things conſiderable, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt we are conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted righteous; then eſteemed or pronounced ſuch; and at laſt treated as ſuch. The firſt conferrs a righteouſneſs upon us; the ſecond ownes and declares it; the third gives us the conſequent reward thereof.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:60626:157"/>The firſt we have in that phraſe of Juſtifying the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. for that, unleſs it were collative of a Righteouſneſs, would be the ſame abomination with the Juſtifying the Wicked, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. The ſecond in that phraſe of Juſtifying the Righteous, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.1. where the word (Juſtifying) is not <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionis, ſed aeſtimationis &amp; declarationis ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum:</hi> the third is not ſo much a part of Juſtification, as a conſequent of it; neither do I remember that it is called Juſtification in Scripture: The firſt is the foundation of the other two; unleſs a Man be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted righteous, God, who is Truth it ſelf, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſteem or pronounce him ſuch: for that were for him to err, which is impoſſible; neither can he, who is Sanctity it ſelf, treat him as ſuch; for an unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon cannot poſſibly enter into the holy Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where Eternal Life is given to the Righteous.</p>
               <p>The main <hi>Quaere</hi> in Juſtification is, What it is that conſtitutes us righteous before God: Righteouſneſs relates to ſome Law: we are under a double Law; the one the Law of Nature or Creation, which calls for perfect Obedience in every point. The other the Law of Grace, which accepts of ſincerity; we muſt, if juſtified, be made righteous to both theſe, accordingly I ſhall diſcourſe of both.</p>
               <p>We are under the Moral Law of Nature; this is immortalized by its own intrinſecal rectitude; it ſo naturally reſults out of the Relation which Man ſtands in towards God, that as long as God is God, the Supream Truth and Goodneſs, and Man Man, a Creature endued with Reaſon and Will, it cannot ceaſe to be, or to oblige: it is not imaginable, that ſuch a thing as Reaſon ſhould be unbound to look up to the original Truth, from whence it came, or that
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:60626:157"/>ſuch a thing as Free-will, ſhould be unbound to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that infinite Good which made it; this Law ſtands faſter than the pillars of Heaven and Earth: it hath a double Sanction; a promiſe of Eternal Life upon perfect obedience, and a threatning of eternal Death upon the leaſt Tranſgreſſion. The promiſe though never abrogated by God, could not of it ſelf bud or bring forth Life; a Sinner, becauſe a Sinner, not being capable of perfect obedience, could not have Life from that promiſe, <hi>ceſſat materia.</hi> There could be no perſon capable of the promiſed Life; the Law was weak, though not in it ſelf, yet through the Fleſh, the ſin of Man. Man ſinned away the Promiſe, but the Threatning he could not ſin away; nay, by his ſin he put himſelf under the Curſe and Wrath of it. Sin made him a fit object and fuel for theſe; the caſe ſtanding thus, how or which way ſhould a Sinner be juſtified as to the Law? In a Sinner there was matter enough for the Treatning, but more for the Promiſe. Death might juſtly ſeize him, but Life he was not payable of by vertue of that Law; here infinite Wiſdom found out that which no created Eye could ſpy out, a way of Juſtification without abrogating the Law: thus therefore it was contrived, the Law, being under the power of the Legiſlator, was relaxed, though not abrogated; there may be a double notion of the Law; either it may be taken as it is in it ſelf, <hi>in ſummo apice,</hi> in its primordial rigor, requiring perfect perſonal obedience from us; and thus it doth not, cannot juſtifie us; there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an utter impoſſibility upon it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. Righteouſneſs could not come by the Law, nay, in this ſenſe it worketh wrath, it condemns and curſes the Sinner; or elſe it may be taken as it is by the great
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:60626:158"/>Legiſlator relaxed, to admit of a ſatisfaction in our Sponſor <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and thus it hath its end, its <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Righteouſneſs which ſatisfied it in him; thus it cannot condemn Believers: a ſatisfied Law, ſo far as it is ſatisfied, hath nothing to ſay againſt them who partake of that ſatisfaction: That of Learned Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> is remarkable, <hi>Juſtificatio noſtri tum ab Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelio, tum à Lege pendet; à Lege quatenùs eidem ſatisfit pro delictis adversùs eam admiſſis; ab Evangelio, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenùs ſatisfactio, non à nobis, ſed à Chriſto Vicariâ ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>râ pro nobis exhibetur;</hi> The Goſpel reveals ſuch a Sponſor as hath ſatisfied the Law for us; the Law being ſatisfied cannot condemn thoſe who partake of that ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>It appears by this, That <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs is that which conſtitutes us righteous as to the Law; only here many worthy learned Divines are at a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, how it doth ſo: doubtleſs it doth it in a way of Imputation, but the mode of that Imputation is not agreed on. Some ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification, and ſo imputed to us in the effects, in that pardon which diſcharges us from the Law: Others, That it is it ſelf in ſome ſort imputed to us, and ſo becomes the material cauſe of our Juſtification; I take it, our former Divines, who diſputed with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> about Imputed Righteouſneſs, are of the latter opinion. Hence Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">De Juſt. hab. fol. <hi>364, 373.</hi>
                  </note> that, <hi>Ipſiſſima Chriſti obedientia nobis imputatur, quaſi eſſet noſtra perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis;</hi> The very obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is imputed to us, as if it were our perſonal Righteouſneſs. And again he ſaith, that <hi>In ſe,</hi> it is <hi>cauſa meritoria Juſtificationis;</hi> but as it is apply'd to Believers, <hi>Subit vicem cauſae formalis,</hi> it is in the room of a formal cauſe. 'Tis
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:60626:158"/>true, he ſaith, That it is imputed to us <hi>ad aliquem effectum;</hi> not that it is imputed only in the effect, but that it is imputed in a meaſure, and to ſome intents, though not in the full latitude, or as it is in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Learned Profeſſors of <hi>Leyden</hi> determine thus: <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum hîc videri non debet Chriſti Juſtitiam non merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae ſolùm, ſed &amp; materialis, imò &amp; formalis cauſae ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem habere, cum id diverſimodè fiat, nempe, quâ illud eſt, propter quod, in quo, ſive ex quo, &amp; per quod juſtificamur:</hi> To quote no more, If <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs be only a meritorious cauſe of Juſtification, then our former Divines have ſtriven in the dark, the Controverſies between them and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in this point have been but a vain jangling; no <hi>Papiſt</hi> ever denied, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> merited Juſtification for us, no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſhould ask any more. The Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> laying down the cauſes of Juſtification, ſaith, <hi>Chiſtus ſuâ ſanctiſſimâ Paſſione in ligno Crucis nobis Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtificationem meruit, &amp; pro nobis Deo Patri ſatisfecit.</hi> Here our Divines ſhould have acquieſced in ſilence, but ſurely they thought there was ſomewhat more in it: For my own part, I conceive <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs is ſo far imputed to us, as to be the matter of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; before I come to offer my Reaſons, I ſhall lay down ſeveral things tending to explain my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this point.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is a double Imputation. The one, when a thing inherent or tranſient is imputed to the very Subject or Agent of it. The other, when it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to thoſe in conjunction with the Subject or Agent, as being parts and portions of him. The firſt Imputation is according to the courſe of Nature, the ſecond is according to ſome juſt conſtitution made touching the ſame: the former is unqueſtionable,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:60626:159"/>the latter is that which is to be cleared, that ſuch an Imputation is poſſible; and when it is done, truth may appear by theſe Inſtances. The primitive Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs of our Nature was only inherent in <hi>Adam:</hi> Yet was it imputed to us; we were by God eſteemed as righteous in him, elſe we are not fallen Creatures, neither do we need any ſuch thing as Regeneration. <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin was an act done by him, yet is it impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us; it is derived down upon us as Members of him, elſe the want of Righteouſneſs in us is not a privative want of what we once had in <hi>Adam,</hi> and afterwards loſt in him, but a meer negative want, as being only of that we never had or forfeited: <hi>Adam</hi>'s Righteouſneſs being not imputed to us, we never had it; <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin being not imputed to us, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forfeited it; ſuch a meer negative want is no ſin. Nay, if <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin be not imputed to us, our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent pravity is no ſin; it cannot be ſin in unfallen Creatures; it is no ſin to be born into the World; there is no foundation in us to make it ſin; and the conſequence of this is, that there is no ſuch thing as original ſin at all in us, which to ſay, is to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Doctrine of the Church in all Ages: We ſee here, that ſuch an imputation to thoſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction is poſſible, becauſe it is actually done; and it muſt needs be true, becauſe it is done by God, who is Truth it ſelf, and cannot err. You will ſay, It cannot be true, primitive Righteouſneſs was never in us, we never committed <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin: I anſwer, This is one thing which over-turns Religion; we are apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that as falſe, which our weak Reaſon cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. Is not an internal ſin in the Will imputed to the Members of the Body? if not, why muſt the Body riſe and ſuffer for it? if ſo, ſin may be imputed
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:60626:159"/>to that which it never reſided in; in this caſe the conjunction ſalves the matter; and by a parity of Reaſon, <hi>Adam</hi>'s Righteouſneſs and Sin may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, as being parts and Members of him; and the Imputation is true, becauſe it is to thoſe in conjunction, and according to a juſt conſtitution. God ſet <hi>Adam</hi> to be a Head of Mankind; we are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated from him as Branches from the Root; his fin therefore may be juſtly imputed to us: the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of it is according to the Divine Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But the reaſon of that Imputation is, becauſe <hi>Adam,</hi> the Head of Mankind, ſinned, and all in him: It is a pretty queſtion which is ſtarted in <hi>Anſelm,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Concept. Virg. cap. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> how the Senſes and Members in Man ſhould be guilty of ſin, when God himſelf ſubjected them to Man's Will? I anſwer, God's order was meet and congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ſo ſubjecting them; yet the act of the Will renders them guilty, as being in conjunction with it: in like manner, God's Conſtitution that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be the Head of Mankind, was juſt and equitable, but this tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam</hi> derives a guilt upon us, as being parts and Members of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. The Conjunction between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and us muſt be conſidered, and that is double.</p>
               <p>The one is that Conjunction which is between Chriſt and Mankind in common; the Titles given to Chriſt will manifeſt it; he is a Mediator, not only an internuntial one, but a ſatisfying and atoning one, a Mediator above all Peer or Parallel, and that in all his Offices, in which he acted not as a private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or in his own name only, But, as the Office was in Gods or ours; in his Prophetical and Kingly Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he acted in God's Name towards us; in his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office, he acted in our Name towards God; hence
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:60626:160"/>the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that every Prieſt is ordained</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for Men, Heb.</hi> 5.1. to act in their behalf towards God: he was our Sponſor or Surety, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ſatisfie Juſtice for us. <hi>Loe, I come to do thy will, O God, ſaith he, Heb.</hi> 10.7. Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices could not pay our Debts, but he would do it; and for that purpoſe he took an Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do it in: never was there ſuch a Surety as he; he undertook to ſatisfie for us, not as common Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do, upon a meer contingency, but upon a certain determinate Counſel; not when we were ſolvents or able to reimburſe him again, but when we were known utter bankrupts, under a perfect impoſſibility to expiate the leaſt ſin. So plenary was that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that if we receive him by Faith, we are Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors no longer, all our debts are blotted out of God's Book, no more to be charged upon us; a ſecond pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be demanded of us; he was the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of Mankind. He did <hi>ſuſtinere noſtram perſonam,</hi> he ſtood in our room; he ſuffered in our ſtead, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>noſtro bono,</hi> but <hi>noſtro loco:</hi> it may be thought per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not a proper ſubſtitute; but it was well ſaid by the Learned <hi>Rivet</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Regulis &amp; Legibus humanis Deum alligare vult pulvis &amp; cinis:</hi> We are apt to limit the Holy one to our Rules and meaſures: But if the Myſteries of <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be put into the ſtraights of humane Laws and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he can ſcarce be properly any thing of that which the Scripture aſcribes to him, he cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be a Surety and a Mediator too, much leſs a Prieſt and a Sacrifice too; leaſt of all theſe, and a Redeemer too in the ſame ſufferings: A Mediator doth not pay as a Surety doth; nor a Surety offer as a Prieſt doth; nor a Prieſt die as a Sacrifice doth;
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:60626:160"/>neither is a Redeemer the very ſame with theſe, but diſtinct from them all; may there be a proper Prieſt and Redeemer, a proper Offering and Paying, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sacrifice and Price in the ſame ſufferings: theſe conjunctions ſeem to carry difficulty in them. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, I verily believe, that he was properly all theſe, yet in a way of tranſcendency above humane Law and Reaſon; it is obſervable in Scripture, that one notion of Chriſt runs into another, the notion of a Mediator into that of a Redeemer; he is a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>who gave himſelf a ranſom,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, &amp; 6. the notion of a Mediator into that of a Prieſt, <hi>he is a Mediator for the Redemption of Tranſgreſſions, Heb.</hi> 9.15. that is, for the expiation of them by offering up himſelf to God, as it is in the precedent verſe; the notion of a Prieſt into that of a Surety: hence in the midſt of a Divine Diſcourſe touching his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, comes in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the ſurety of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. nay, it is obſervable, that theſe notions of Chriſt are interwoven with that of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, as the mode of performing them. Thus as a Prieſt he gave himſelf an Offering and a Sacrifice for us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. as a Redeemer he was made a Curſe for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. as a Mediator and Redeemer he gave himſelf a ranſom for all, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, &amp; 6. in each of which the ſubſtitution comes in: hence it appears, that Chriſt is properly all theſe; or elſe, as <hi>Socinus</hi> would have it, <hi>all ſeems to be but a Metaphor.</hi> To add no more, theſe Conjunctions tell us, that Chriſt was ſo far one with us, that thoſe things fell upon him, which otherwiſe he was utterly incapable of. The Holy One was made ſin, the Bleſſed One a curſe; his ſufferings were properly penal, ſuch as were not inflicted by Soveraignty, but Juſtice, ſuch
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:60626:161"/>as were not the Curſe cauſleſs, but merited by ſin; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they were merited by ſin, they were meer ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not puniſhment; puniſhment for nothing, is no puniſhment: if there was no puniſhment in his ſufferings, how were they ſatisfactory? If there was no merit of ſin to procure them, how were they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? If Juſtice inflicted them not, how were they a puniſhment? or, if they were penal, how could Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice inflict them upon an Innocent? Here we have nothing to ſay, but this, Chriſt was ſo far made one with us, as to render his ſufferings penal and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory.</p>
               <p>The other is that ſpecial conjunction, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and Believers; <hi>Chriſt is the Head, they are the Members:</hi> the Ligatures of this Myſtical U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are the Holy Spirit and Faith, <hi>the quickning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> (ſaith the reverend <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>) <hi>deſcends downwards from the head to be in us a fountain of ſupernatural life;</hi> a lively Faith, wrought by the ſame Spirit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends from us upward to lay faſt hold upon him. The Scripture notably ſets forth this Union, <hi>We dwell in Chriſt, and he in us,</hi> John 6.56. <hi>We abide in him, and he in us,</hi> John 15.4. <hi>We are Members of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones,</hi> Epheſ. 5.30, 32. <hi>And he is in us the hope of Glory,</hi> Col. 1.27. This the Apoſtle calls a great Myſtery, and the Riches of the Glory of the Myſtery; we are ingraſted into him as Branches into a Root; cemented to him as the building is to the foundation; incorporated with him as the food is with our Bodies; united to him as Members are to the Head. We eat his Fleſh, and drink his Blood, and become one Spirit with him; nothing can be more emphatical, the Holy Spirit, which reſides in him the Head, falls down upon us
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:60626:161"/>his Members, and ſo makes a kind of continuity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and us, too Spiritual and Divine to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by any local diſtance: Hence St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> ſaith, that there is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">Com. <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>3.11.</hi>
                  </note> no <hi>medium</hi> or middle between Chriſt and us; hence St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, that, <hi>Fideles ſiunt cum homine Chriſto unus Chriſtus, Believers are made one Chriſt with the Man Chriſt,</hi> the Head and the Body make up one Chriſt: Hence that of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that Chriſt and his Members are but, <hi>una perſona myſtica, one myſtical perſon;</hi> the conſequence of this admirable Union is the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Divine Bleſſings from him to us, <hi>tota verae juſtitiae, ſalutis, vitae participatio ex hâc perne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſariâ cum Chriſto</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The righteouſneſs of Chriſt may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken under a double notion, either as it was the very <hi>idem</hi> to all the Laws he was under, or elſe as it was the <hi>tantundem,</hi> a plenary ſatisfaction to the moral Law by us violated; in the firſt notion it was a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs <hi>ex naturâ ſuâ,</hi> being a perfect conformity to thoſe Laws; in the ſecond it was a ſatisfaction <hi>ex di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinâ ordinatione,</hi> being by God ordained ſo to be; in the firſt notion it was not for us; who, being once ſinners, were incapable of it. But for himſelf to juſtifie and ſanctifie him in that ſtate, which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to be in: In the ſecond it was not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; who, as being pure from all ſin, was incapable of it; but for us, to juſtifie us ſinners againſt the Law: Here I ſhall only add, that, under the notion of ſatisfaction, I take in all Chriſt's righteouſneſs, Active as well as Paſſive; though I think the Active in it ſelf alone could not have amounted to a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:60626:162"/>becauſe without ſhedding of blood there was no remiſſion to be; yet the Active being in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Paſſive, is a part of the ſatisfaction, and makes it the more compleat; for a ſatisfaction made up of both together, anſwers the threatning, and honours the precept of the Law; it ſatisfies God's Juſtice in it ſelf by penal ſufferings, and in its foundation, that is, God's holineſs, by perfect obedience.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Active and Paſſive Righteouſneſs of Chriſt are not imputed to us, as they are the Idem, a perfect conformity to the Laws he was under; for we were not under the Mediatorial Law: nor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once ſinners, are we capable of a perfect confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the moral: but they are imputed to us, as they are the <hi>tantundem,</hi> a plenary ſatisfaction to the moral Law by us broken; for ſo they are very apt and proper to juſtifie ſinners againſt the Law: Neither is Chriſt's ſatisfaction imputed to all actually to juſtifie them againſt the Law, for all are not juſtified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, but it is imputed to Believers, as being myſtical parts and portions of him: hence that Learned Biſhop ſaith,<note place="margin">Dav. de Juſt. hab. <hi>369.</hi>

                  <hi>Quia inſiti ſumus in corpus ejus, &amp; coaleſcimus cum illo in unam perſonam, ideò ejus juſtitia noſtra reputatur,</hi> becauſe we are ingrafted into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and grow as it were, into one Perſon with him, therefore his Righteouſneſs is reputed ours; neither is Chriſt's ſatisfaction imputed to his belleving Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers according to its fulneſs and latitude as it is in Chriſt the Head, but in ſuch ſort and meaſure as is meet for it to be communicated to Members: this is notably illuſtrated in the parallel of the two <hi>Adams,</hi> who are two ſuch communicative Heads, as never were the like, who communicate to theirs in ſuch
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:60626:162"/>proportion as is congruous between Head and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin is derived to each of us, not in its full latitude, but <hi>pro menſurâ membri;</hi> and in like manner, Chriſt's ſatisfaction is derived to each Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, not in its full latitude, but <hi>pro menſurâ membri;</hi> ſo much of <hi>Ada</hi>'s ſin comes upon each one of us, as ſoon as he is <hi>proles Adae,</hi> as makes him a ſinner; ſo much of Chriſt's ſatisfaction comes upon each one of us, as ſoon as he is <hi>proles Chriſti,</hi> as makes him Righteous againſt the Law; in both there is a communication to Members, yet in ſuch a way, as that the difference between Head and Members is obſerved.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There was a Divine Conſtitution, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhould be our Sponſor, and ſtanding in our room, ſhould ſatisfie for us, that he ſhould be an Head to Believers, and his ſatisfaction ſhould ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come theirs, as to juſtifie them againſt the Law: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly that ſatisfaction is truly imputed to them. Some Perſons have been pleaſed to ſpeak of Imputed Righteouſneſs, as if it were a fancy, a meer putative imaginary thing; but we ſee here upon what grounds it ſtands: the firſt Foundation of it, is the Divine conſtitution made touching Chriſt; the intermediate Foundation is this, that Chriſt was our Sponfor and ſatisfied for us: the immediate Foundation is this, that Chriſt is a communicating Head to his believing Members, and they as Members participate in his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; theſe things are ſufficient to make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude as Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> doth, <hi>Imputatio non nititur fictitiâ aliquâ ſuppoſitione, ſed verâ participatione rei imputatae: Imputation doth not ſtand upon any fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſuppoſition, but upon a true participation of the thing imputed.</hi> Theſe things being thus laid down, I
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:60626:163"/>ſhall come directly to the point, my Opinion is, That the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not meerly the meritorious cauſe of Juſtification, but ſomwhat more; neither is it meerly imputed to us in the Effects, but it ſelf, as a ſatisfaction, is ſo far imputed to us, as to be the material cauſe of Juſtification, as to the Law, I think nothing can be more proper to juſtifie us as the Law than that which ſatisfied it. I cannot tell how to ſuppoſe that one thing ſhould ſatisfie the Law, and another juſtifie againſt it: And here I ſhall firſt lay down my Reaſons, and then anſwer the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions made againſt my Opinion: For Reaſons I ſhall offer ſeveral things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall begin with that memorable phraſe, <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> which cannot but be of great moment in this point: ſome take it for the mercy of God, and ſo it is ſometimes taken in the Old Teſtament, <hi>The Mercy of the Lord is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that fear him, and his Righteouſneſs unto Childrens Children, Pſal.</hi> 103.17. where Mercy and Righteouſneſs are one and the ſame; but in the New Teſtament, where this phraſe often occurs, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo taken; the Righteouſneſs of God is revealed in the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. Revealed, that, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was only obſcurely hinted, was in the Goſpel clearly opened; but the Mercy of God was not only darkly hinted, but openly proclaimed in very high and ſtately terms in the Old Teſtament. An Inſtance we have of it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, and 7. where the Titles of Mercy carry as much of Glory and Magnificence as any thing can do. We are ſaid to be made the Righteouſneſs of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. but never to be made his Mercy; neither would be at all proper to ſay ſo. Others take it for our Inherent Graces, which
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:60626:163"/>are our Evangelical Righteouſneſs; but theſe, though they come down from Heaven, are never called the Righteouſneſs; nay, on the contrary they are called our own, as being inherent in us: Hence we find Your Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8. your Love, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8. your Patience, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.19. your Hope, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. your Righteouſneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. that, which in Scripture is called the Righteouſneſs of God, is not the ſame with that which is called our own there; were our Inherent Graces imported in that phraſe. Faith, which is a prime excellent Grace, muſt have its ſhare therein; but the Righteouſneſs of God is by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. Therefore it is not Faith, the Righteouſneſs of God is upon the Believer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not in him: Others take it for Pardon; but neither can this Interpretation ſtand. The <hi>Jews</hi> were ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. but ſurely they were not ignorant, that God was a God pardoning iniquity, that Pardon which in the Old Teſtament is elegantly decyphered by Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Blotting out, Remembring no more, Caſting away ſin, is not in the New vailed in an Expreſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo obſcure and improper for it, as that of the Righteouſneſs of God ſeems to be to that intent; leaving theſe, I take it, that the Righteouſneſs of God imports that of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and in this ſence the phraſe is as Glorious and Illuſtrious, as it would be obſcure and improper to denote Pardon: The Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is indeed the Righteouſneſs of God; it is the Righteouſneſs of him who is God, of him, whoſe Blood is called the Blood of God; it is a pure perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which can conſiſt before the Tribunal of God, which was by God ordained to make us Righteous: This is it which, being before but darkly hinted, was in
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:60626:164"/>the Goſpel manifeſtly revealed; this is that which is upon the Believer as a rich Covering to hide his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, this is it which the <hi>Jews</hi> were ignorant of, and ſubmitted not unto: the Apoſtle tells us, That they ſubmitted not to the Righteouſneſs of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. and what that Righteouſneſs is, the next Verſe expreſſes; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the end of the Law for Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs to every one that believeth; the Law hath its end in nothing but in his Righteouſneſs, which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied it. But beſides there is one place, which <hi>in terminis</hi> calls the Righteouſneſs of God the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to them who have obtained like preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Faith with us through the Righteouſneſs of God and our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. Obſerve, it is not through the Righteouſneſs <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of God, and of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as noting two Perſons, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of God and our Saviour, as betokening one, as Biſhop <hi>Downham</hi> hath obſerved; like that <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13. <hi>The glorious Appearance of the great God and our Saviour,</hi> where one Perſon is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: Thus far it appears, that the Righteouſneſs of God denotes the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> That which remains is to enquire, Whether the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God never import any more than a meer meritorious cauſe: 'Tis true in that place 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. it imports no more; but in others it ſpeaks further: <hi>We are made the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God is upon us, Rom.</hi> 3.22. and, as a paraphraſe upon the Righteouſneſs of God, the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to the Believer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. Here I take it, the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſet forth not only as a meritorious antecedent cauſe of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but as an Ingredient, a material cauſe in it: he
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:60626:164"/>that hath only the effect, cannot be ſaid to be made the Impetrating cauſe, no more can we be ſaid to be made the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if we only have the fruit of it, not the thing it ſelf: That Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as a meritorious cauſe, may be ſaid to be for us; but not to be upon us, unleſs by Imputation it be made ours: <hi>Chriſt</hi> in reſpect of Merit only is no more for Righteouſneſs (which yet is the Emphaſis of the Text) than for ſanctifying Graces, theſe being as much merited as the other; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſo far Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs as he is the end of the Law, and that he is in the ſatisfaction it ſelf, not in Remiſſion, which is the effect of it; the Satisfaction it ſelf therefore is made ours in Juſtification. It ſeems to me a great depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Text to ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs, that is for Pardon, which is the Effect, or for Impunity, which is the Effect of the Effect.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is utterly impoſſible that there ſhould be a Juſtification without a Righteouſneſs. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Juſtification makes us Righteous, Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or ſentential Juſtification eſteems or pronounces us ſuch; a Juſtification cannot be without a Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs; nor can any thing be a Righteouſneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it anſwer the Law. What then is our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as to the Law? Faith, anſwers the Goſpel terms: But what anſwers the Law? Surely nothing under Heaven can do it but <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Satisfaction. The <hi>Quaere</hi> therefore is, Whether that Satisfaction be our Righteouſneſs in it ſelf, or only in its effects: if in the effects only, then ſomething leſs than Chriſt's ſatisfaction, <hi>viz.</hi> an effect, is our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to the Law, and by conſequence ſomething leſs than that ſatisfies the Law: I cannot imagine
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:60626:165"/>that one thing ſhould ſatisfie the Law, and another juſtifie againſt it; one and the ſame ſatisfaction of Chriſt doth both. There are but two ſorts of Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs as to the Law; the one a Righteouſneſs in the <hi>idem,</hi> a direct conformity to it; the other a Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs in valor, a full compenſation or ſatisſaction for the breaches of it, a third cannot be found, where there is neither ſuch a conformity to the Law, that all is done as it ought to be, nor ſuch a ſatisfaction to it, that all that is done amiſs, is compenſated, there is no ſuch thing as Righteouſneſs, a pardon or freedom from puniſhment there may be, but a Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs there is not. Becauſe there is nothing done to the Law; either by way of obedience or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; and where nothing is done to the Law, there cannot be a Righteouſneſs: Now a Sinner not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable of a Righteouſneſs of conſormity, his Righteouſneſs muſt be that of a ſatisfaction or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; not an effect of it, but the thing it ſelf, no other thing can be a Sinners Righteouſneſs. It is obſervable in Scripture, That Juſtification is ſo ſet forth, that the Law is eſtabliſhed in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. that its Righteouſneſs is fulfilled, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. that it hath its end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. And all this becauſe in Chriſt's Satisfaction there is a full compenſution made for ſin, ſuch as comes in the room of a perfect conformity, and ſupplies that defect of it which riſes out of the ſuult committed: This is done by the Satisfaction it ſelf, not by an effect of it. Nothing leſs than it ſelf could give the Law its end or eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: If that Satisfaction be our Righteouſneſs, not in it ſelf but in its effects, what is that effect? Is it a Pardon? that is God's act; God's act may make or eſteem us righteous, but it is not the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:60626:165"/>it ſelf; it is a <hi>jus impunitatis</hi> that is not the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs it ſelf; a Righteouſneſs as to the Law muſt be either a perfect conformity or a ſatisfaction, but a <hi>Jus impunitatis</hi> is neither of theſe; as in Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the <hi>Obligatio ad paenam</hi> is not the very <hi>culpa,</hi> but a conſequent of it. So in Juſtification the <hi>Jus impunitatis</hi> is not the very Righteouſneſs, but a conſequent of it. A <hi>Jus impunitatis</hi> is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the <hi>reatus paenae;</hi> but a Satisfaction, which is our true Righteouſneſs, is oppoſite to the <hi>reatus cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae,</hi> as compenſating the fault committed. It remains therefore that Chriſt's Satisfaction is not in its effects, but in it ſelf our Righteouſneſs, which alſo further appears: In that, when we are to anſwer for our breaches of the Law, our great Plea is to that no other than his Satisfaction; <hi>Oſtendo fide juſſorem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Juſt. hab. <hi>370.</hi>
                  </note> ſaith Biſhop <hi>Davenant,</hi> When the Law makes its demands againſt me, I ſhew my Sponſor Chriſt, who ſatisfied it. Now, if his Satisfaction be it ſelf our Righteouſneſs, it muſt be made ours by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that which is not ours, cannot be our Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs; neither doth God, who judgeth according to Truth, eſteem it ſuch: You will ſay, Though it ſelf be not ours, yet it is that for which God doth juſtifie us: To which I anſwer, Though God juſtifie us for it, yet, unleſs it be ours, it is no more our Righteouſneſs than it is our Holineſs; when God ſanctifies us for it, no Man (I think) will call it our Holineſs, no more, unleſs it be ours, may we call it our Righteouſneſs. If it be ours by Imputation, then it is more than a meritorious cauſe. It is the very matter of our Juſtification; neither can I tell how to think it leſs, ſeeing a Sinner is capable of no other Righteouſneſs, as to the Law, but a Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:60626:166"/>ſeeing ſo glorious a Satisfaction, as that of Chriſt is, is uſhered into the World for that very end; it is to me unimaginable, that that Satisfaction ſhould yet not be our Righteouſneſs as to the Law, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than it ſelf ſhould have the honour of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Very momentous in this point, is the collation of the two <hi>Adams, Rom.</hi> 5. the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was the Origen of Sin; Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> was the Origen of Righteouſneſs and Life: never were there in the World two ſuch Heads as theſe, <hi>uterque quod ſuumeſt cum ſuis communicat,</hi> as the Learned <hi>Beza</hi> hath it, <hi>Adam</hi> communicates Sin and Death to his Poſterity; Chriſts Righteouſneſs and Life to his believing Seed, in the parallel it is obſervable, that Chriſt is as ſtrong; nay, a ſtronger Head than <hi>Adam, Adam</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Type of him that was to come; and leſs then the Antitype, who was more potent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build the ruines of the fall, than <hi>Adam</hi> was to make them, Righteouſneſs came as full from Chriſt, as ſin did from <hi>Adam;</hi> nay, more fully, as the Apoſtle hints in the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>verſe.</hi> 15. and in the abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and ſuperabundance of Grace, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. &amp; 20. hence it appears, that ſo far as <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin was ours, ſo far is Chriſt's Righteouſneſs ours alſo. <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin was not ours in the full latitude, as it was in him, we did not eat the Fruit in our own perſons, we were not heads of Mankind, we did not uſher in Sin and Death upon the World, no, this was, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by that one <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> neither was it ours in the effect only, for then our innate pravity would be no ſin, as meerly proceeding from that firſt ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> in which we participated not: that in the Schools muſt needs be true, <hi>peccatum habituale dicit eſſentialem ordinem ad praecedens actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le; Its impoſſible, that one ſhould be a ſinner habitually, who in no ſenſe was a ſinner before:</hi> hence that of St.

                  <hi>Auſtin,</hi> quoted by Dr. <hi>Ward, Nulla foret hominis culpa, ſt talis a Deo Creatus eſſet, qualis nunc naſcitur,</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains therefore that <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin it ſelf is derived to each one of us, <hi>pro ratione membri,</hi> proportionably: Chriſt's ſatisfaction is not ours in the full latitude, as it was in him; we ſatisſied not God's Juſtice in our own Perſons, we were not Heads of the Church, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did we uſher in Life and Righteouſneſs into the World; no, it was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by that one Chriſt, neither is it ours in the effect only; for then the effect a thing leſs than the ſatisfaction it ſelf, ſhould juſtifie or make us righteous againſt the Law, which cannot be: It remains therefore that it is it ſelf derived upon each one of us, <hi>pro menſurâ membri:</hi> Again, <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin did firſt in order of Nature, make us ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by it ſelf imputed, and then by the inherent pravity conſequent; in like manner Chriſt's ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction doth firſt in order of Nature make us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by it ſelf imputed, and then by the ſanctifying Graces communicated by vertue of it: Now if Chriſts ſatisfaction be not it ſelf communicated to us as Members of him; then the Glory of his Headſhip ſeems to fail, he is not ſo ſtrong an Head as <hi>Adam,</hi> Righteouſneſs is not ſo amply communicated from Chriſt, as ſin is from <hi>Adam, Adam</hi> communicates the ſin it ſelf to us, but Chriſt communicates his Righteouſneſs in the effects only; if Chriſt only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Juſtification, the Glory of his Headſhip ſeems not to ſtand in it; in Sanctification he as our Head communicates ſanctifying Graces to us, to be the matter of our Sanctification, but in Juſtification he doth not communicate his ſatisfaction to us, to be the matter of our Juſtification; he merited Juſtification upon Goſpel-terms before our Union with him,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:60626:167"/>What doth he after, or more, as our head in Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? his ſatisfaction not being communicated to us, he ſeems not to be ſo compleat an Head in Juſtification, as in Sanctification; to make this Argument from Chriſt's Headſhip more clear, it will not be amiſs to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome paſſages in that fifth Chapter to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; Wherefore as by one Man ſin entred into the World, and Death by Sin, and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned, verſe</hi> 12. in this and the two following verſes one part of the collation, <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>Adam</hi> being laid down, where is the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:60626:168"/>no, not in the effect: yet if ſin was Imputed to him only in the effect, it follows not, that his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be ſo only Imputed to us, the Apoſtle ſaith not, as he was made ſin, ſo we are made Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, there is no (as and ſo) in that Text as there is in the parallel of the <hi>Adam's:</hi> there is a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity in the caſes; Sin was not imputed to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to conſtitute him a ſinner, but <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is imputed to us to conſtitute us righteous; Sin was imputed to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that it might be abſorpt and ſwallowed up in his ſweet-ſmelling Sacrifice; but <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Righteouſneſs is imputed to us, that it may abide upon us as the matter of our Juſtification: We ſee here, in the point of Imputed Righteouſneſs, we muſt take our meaſures; not from our ſin imputed to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but from <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin imputed to us: Further, The word (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) in the 19. Verſe emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally points out the material cauſe of Juſtification. <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Righteouſneſs, as a meritorious cauſe, is an impulſive to God to conſtitute us righteous, but to be an impulſive to conſtitute is not properly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, as a meritorious cauſe it impetrates, that we ſhall be made righteous; but by that Impetration it doth no more make us righteous, than by the Impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſanctifying Graces it makes us holy: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe Impetrations, we are not indeed holy without thoſe Graces, nor are we righteous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Righteouſneſs: as a meritorious cauſe it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith, nay, before the Covenant of Promiſe, but then it conſtituted none righteous. It was for all, but it conſtitutes not all: You will ſay, As ſoon as a Man by Faith hath a capacity, it conſtitutes him righteous; How ſo? It was a meritorious cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith, now it is no more; at the firſt it procured
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:60626:168"/>that Men ſhould be juſtified upon Goſpel-terms, and now what new or freſh act or energy hath it? Indeed there is ſomewhat more on Man's part, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith; ſomewhat more on God's <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtifying the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. But what is there more on <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s? the merit is as before, one and the ſame, and impetrates Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation on Goſpel-terms for all; on our part there is a difference, one believes, not another; on God's a difference, he juſtifies one, not another; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtands only as a common cauſe, his Satisfaction is <hi>in communi,</hi> and conſtitutes no one righteous more than another: He is no more, as it ſeems, the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to the Believer, than to the Unbeliever. Now if this be, as it is <hi>durus ſermo,</hi> then it remains that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs is by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular imputation made over to Believers, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the matter of their Juſtification; accordingly the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> the fifth ſpeaks of it, not as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe, but as peculiarized to Believers, ſuch as receive Grace: He doth not ſpeak of what <hi>Chriſt</hi> merited for all, but of what Chriſt as an Head com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to his Members: The ſcope of the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel between the two <hi>Adams</hi> evinces this; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other than this, That both of them commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to thoſe, who are in them. The ſum of all is, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> are ſet forth by the Apoſtle as two communicative Heads; if <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin be imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely ours, ſo is <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs alſo.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now paſs on to another Reaſon: But poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſome may object, That there is a great difference between the two Heads. We were ſeminally in <hi>Adam,</hi> we receive an Humane Nature from him; but we were not ſeminally in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we receive not a Nature from him: therefore, though <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin be
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:60626:169"/>imputatively ours, yet ſo is not <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. In anſwer to this I ſhall offer ſeveral things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We receive an Humane Nature from <hi>Adam;</hi> but is this the only foundation of the Imputation of his ſin to us? No, ſurely: Then all the ſins of our Progenitors ſhould be as much imputed to us, as the firſt ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was. Which I cannot at all believe; <hi>Adam</hi> was a moral Head of Holineſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all Mankind, but ſince the fall, no Man, no, not <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, was ſuch; the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally imputed to all, even to the moſt holy, but ſo are not the ſins of other Progenitors; we were not therefore one with <hi>Adam</hi> only by a Natural union, but by a Divine Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We receive an Human Nature from <hi>Adam;</hi> and have we not a Divine Nature from <hi>Chriſt?</hi> are we not called his Seed? are we not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by his Spirit and Word? were we not in a Spiritual ſence ſeminally in his Blood and Merits? how elſe ſhould any ſuch thing as the New Creature, be produced in a lapſed Nature? Theſe things are as proper to make us Parts and Members of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as an Humane Nature is to make us Parts and Members of <hi>Adam;</hi> therefore the communication of Righteouſneſs from <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be as full and great, as the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of ſin is from <hi>Adam.</hi> Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> tells us, That we have a more ſtrict conjunction in the Spirit with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then ever we had in Nature with <hi>Adam,</hi> one and the ſame Spirit is in Chriſt and Believers, but there is not one Soul in <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity: the communication from Chriſt therefore, if anſwerable to the Union, muſt be as great, nay greater than that from <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Adam</hi> was a Head both by Nature, and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:60626:169"/>by Conſtitution; Sin, unleſs in Conjunction with Nature, could not paſs from him to us, neither could we, without a Nature conveyed from him, have been members of him: It di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> therefore appertain to his Headſhip to convey a Nature to us; but Chriſt was an Head not by Nature, But above it by Divine Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; he was not to convey Naturals to us, but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-naturals; ſince the Fall, Righteouſneſs was not to paſs to us, in Conjunction with Nature; Nature was to be from one Head, and Righteouſneſs from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we were to be made Members of Chriſt, not by communication of Nature, but of Grace; it therefore did not appertain to his Headſhip to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Nature to us, yet was his Headſhip as potent to convey Righteouſneſs to us, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s was to convey ſin; the Divine Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made him ſuch an Head, that his Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might become ours for our Juſtification: thus much touching this Argument drawn from the Headſhip of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Thoſe Scripture phraſes of being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſprinkled, cleanſed, waſhed, juſtifyed in the Blood of Chriſt, notably import two things, the one, that Juſtification is in a ſignal manner attributed to Chriſt's Blood, as Sanctification is to the Spirit; the other, that Chriſt's Blood juſtifies by way of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: but neither of theſe can ſtand, if that Blood be only a meritorious cauſe, not the firſt, how can Juſtification, be ſignally attributed to it; when as a meritorious cauſe, it no leſs impetrates Sanctification than Juſtification? nothing ſingular is done by it in the one more than in the other; not the ſecond, how can it juſtifie by Application, when as a merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe, it operates only by impetration? You
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:60626:170"/>will ſay, Chriſt's Blood is applyed in the effect, in a pardon: I anſwer, thoſe Scripture phraſes before quoted, ſhew, that the Blood it ſelf is applyed to us; how elſe is it ſaid, that we are purged, cleanſed, ſprinkled, waſhed in it? unleſs it be applyed to us, the phraſes, how emphatical ſoever, ſeem to be improper: ſurely a ſatisfaction muſt in its own nature be a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying matter againſt the Law, next to an abſolute conformity to the Law. Nothing is or can be more juſtifying againſt it then a ſatisfaction; when God hath provided a plenary ſatisfaction to juſtifie us, how may we think, that it is not it ſelf applyed to us actually to juſtifie us, or that ſomething leſs than it ſelf ſhould do it? the Scripture ſets forth this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication on both hands, on our part it is applyed by Faith, <hi>We receiving the Atonement, Rom.</hi> 5.11. and Chriſt, <hi>being a propitiation through Faith in his Blood, Rom.</hi> 3.25. and on God's part by Imputation, we being <hi>made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>and the Righteouſneſs of God being upon us, Rom.</hi> 3.22. I cannot tell how to think, that ſuch an excellent juſtifying matter, as Chriſt's Satisfaction is, ſhould be provided for us, and yet not applyed to us, according to the terms of the Goſpel: a pardon is, as I take it, upon the ſatisfaction not meerly made but applyed; for it is given to Believers only: if the ſatisfaction be it ſelf applyed, then that is our Righteouſneſs againſt the Law; if it be applyed in the effect, that is, in a pardon, then the pardon is the very application, and not a pardon upon a ſatisfaction applyed; or if there be a pardon upon a ſatisfaction applyed, there will be a pardon before a pardon; a pardon in the application, and a pardon upon it; if the ſatisfaction be it ſelf applyed, then it may precede a
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:60626:170"/>pardon, and a pardon may be upon it; but if it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed only in the effect, in a pardon, then it cannot precede a pardon, no more then a pardon can precede it ſelf: You will ſay, a pardon is not upon a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction applyed, but is the very application. To this I anſwer, the Learned Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> ſaith, <hi>remiſſio eſt Juſtificationis efficacis conſequens neceſſarium;</hi> and the worthy Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ſaith, <hi>culpae remiſſio accuratè conſiderata neque totum neque pars Juſtificationis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtit, ſed contingens tantùm Juſtificationis effectus:</hi> I conceive, the application of Chriſt's Juſtifying Blood, is in order of Nature antecedent to remiſſion; under the Law, firſt the Atonement was made, and Blood ſprinkled, and then there was forgiveneſs; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, firſt Chriſt's Blood is applyed and ſprinkled upon us, and then there is remiſſion; <hi>Chriſt is a propitiation through Faith in his Blood,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. and then he adds, <hi>To declare his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſion of ſins:</hi> Chriſt's Blood is firſt applyed, and then remiſſion follows upon it; I ſay, it follows upon it, but it is no more the ſame with it under the Goſpel, then forgiveneſs under the Law was the ſame with the ſprinklings and purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by the Blood of the Sacrifices; when in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there is attributed to Chriſt's Blood, purging, waſhing, ſprinkling, cleanſing from Sin, and to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, covering, blotting out, taking away, and caſting away of Sin, I cannot imagine that both theſe are the ſame, as if Chriſt's Blood did not by it ſelf do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Sin, but only impetrate that it might be done away in a pardon; I take it, theſe are diſtinct, firſt that Blood in the ſence herein after declared, frees us <hi>à culpâ,</hi> and then the conſequent pardon frees us <hi>à Baenâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:60626:171"/>
               <p>Fifthly, If Chriſt's Righteouſneſs be Imputed to us, not in it ſeif, but in its effect only, that is, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, then Juſtification, as to the Law, wholly conſiſts in a pardon; on the other hand, if Juſtification do not ſtand in a pardon, then it ſtands in the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to us: in this great point I ſhall offer ſeveral things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Scripture muſt be the great Rule to judge of Juſtification by, there I find that we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Chriſt's Blood, that we are made right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous by his Obedience; but that we are juſtified by a Pardon, I find not. There I read that Chriſt is made to us Righteouſneſs, that we are made the Righteouſneſs of God in him; but, not that an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity from puniſhment is a Righteouſneſs. I know many Learned Divines take Juſtification and Pardon to be one and the ſame, but I ſhall conſider the chief Scriptures which look that way; The firſt is <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. There the Imputation of Righteouſneſs, Ver. 6. and the remiſſion of ſin, Verſ. 7. and 8. ſeem to be the very ſame; the quotation of the 32. <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſeems to make it clear to anſwer to this. I ſhall conſider the ſcope of the Apoſtle: He doth in the third Chapter lay down this Concluſion, That we are juſtified by Faith, Ver. 28. and in the fourth Chapter he lays down this, That we are not juſtified by Works, Ver. 4. that is, perfect Works, ſuch as Man may glory in, ſuch as might make the reward of debt. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himſelf could not reach ſuch a Juſtification: this is proved by two things; the one is this, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Faith was counted to him for Righteouſneſs, therefore he was not juſtified by Works: For Faith is not Works. The other is this, A juſtified Man is a pardoned one, therefore he is not juſtified by Works;
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:60626:171"/>for perfect Obedience leaves no room at all for a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Touching the firſt, I ſhall firſt conſider what was the object of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, and then how Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs: The primary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith was Chrriſt; for the Apoſtle in the third Chapter ſpeaks of the Faith of Chriſt; and in the fourth, where the ſame Diſcourſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is continued, the object cannot in any reaſon be varied. <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſet forth as a great pattern of believing, and he can hardly be ſo to Chriſtians, if his Faith had not for ſubſtance the ſame object with theirs. The Scripture fore-ſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through Faith, preached before the Goſpel unto <hi>Abraham;</hi> ſaying, <hi>In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed, Gal.</hi> 3.8. That <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s Faith and ours might have the ſame object, God took care, that a Goſpel,<note place="margin">

'Tis true, our Faith, as having more of Evangelical light in it, is more explicite than <hi>Abraham</hi>'s was; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s was in the <hi>Meſſiah in univerſali,</hi> in more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms; ours is in him <hi>in particulari, in propriâ formâ,</hi> in a ſatisfying atoning <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> in his Blood and Righteouſneſs; nevertheleſs (this being but a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual difference according to gradual Light) our Faith and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s are for ſubſtance the ſame and center in one object; and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, though not ſo clearly known to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as to us, was no leſs imputed to him than to us, there being the ſame way of Juſtification by Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteouſneſs for him as for us. <hi>Chriſt</hi> being the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:60626:172"/>object of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, the next thing is, how Faith is imputed for Righteouſneſs. Here I anſwer, Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs, not as taken <hi>in abſtracto,</hi> meerly in it ſelf, but as taken in <hi>concreto,</hi> in its conjunction with its object: that is, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Righteouſneſs, and then we have the full Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs of Juſtification, Faith in it ſelf anſwering to the Goſpel-terms, and in its object <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs anſwering to the Law. Here I crave leave to ſet down the words of an Excellent Perſon, though different from my ſelf in this point; the words are theſe:<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Charles Wolſ.</hi> Juſtif. Evang. <hi>42.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <q>Faith looks both ways, reſpects both the Law and the Goſpel, and comprizeth all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to our Juſtification with reference to both; all the charge of the Law it anſwers <hi>ratione objecti,</hi> in reſpect of its object, which is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all that is required by the Goſpel, <hi>ratione ſui,</hi> as being it ſelf the performance of the condition annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto.</q> Thus he; I quote not theſe words, as if in this point he were of my opinion, but becauſe they are full and expreſſive of my thoughts: Now, that Faith is in this place to be taken in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with its object, appears thus; the Apoſtle in the third Chapter proves, That as to the Law every Mouth muſt be ſtopped, that all the world muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty before God, verſe 19, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that by the deeds of the Law, no Fleſh can be juſtified, verſe 20. And in his After-diſcourſe (as the following words (but now) do import) he ſheweth what it is that juſtifieth us againſt the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> The Righteouſneſs of God; that is of Chriſt, which is not Faith it ſelf, but by Faith, Verſ. 21, &amp; 22. And at laſt he concludes, That we are juſtified by Faith, Verſ. 28. but Faith in it ſelf cannot juſtifie
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:60626:172"/>us againſt the Law; for Faith was not crucified for us, neither did it ſatisfie Juſtice on our behalf: it is therefore Faith in its object, that is Chriſt's Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs which juſtifies us againſt the Law; that Faith which is counted for Righteouſneſs, is that which eſtabliſhes the Law, Verſ. 31. and that Eſtabliſhment Faith makes, not in it ſelf, but in its object, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, which eſtabliſhed the Law by ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; Faith therefore and its object muſt be taken together: Hence the Apoſtle, who mentions the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Faith. Ver. 5. in the 4. Chapter, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo the Imputation of Righteouſneſs, Ver. 6. It's true, both are but one in ſence, but in words the latter expreſſes the object of Faith, as the former doth the Act: Thus, as I ſaid before, Faith in Conjunction with its object takes in the whole of Juſtification, and then the after-words, quoted out of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Remiſſion, do not deſcribe the Imputation of Righteouſneſs in its proper Nature, but in its bleſſed Fruit, <hi>viz.</hi> Pardon of ſin, which is not properly our Righteouſneſs, but a conſequent upon it. Another place is this; —<hi>Through this Man is preached unto you the Forgiveneſs of ſin; and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which you could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, <hi>&amp;</hi> 39. Here it ſeems, that what is called Remiſſion in the firſt verſe, is called Juſtification in the next: but I take it, they are not the ſame in the 38. Ver. We have Remiſſion in the offer or tender of the Goſpel, in the 39. we have Juſtification actual as it is in the Believer. So they are not the ſame; Juſtification here is not Remiſſion, but Juſtification by Sacrifice; Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chriſt's Sacrifice is oppoſed to Juſtification by the Legal ones: Juſtification by theſe was typical,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:60626:173"/>and but in ſome caſes, the Law not allowing a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in all, but Juſtification by that is real, and in all caſes where Faith is not wanting; here therefore Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and Remiſſion are not the ſame. Another place is <hi>Luke</hi> 18. when the <hi>Publican</hi> penitentially prayed for Pardon, <hi>God be merciful to me a Sinner,</hi> he went home juſtified, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13, <hi>&amp;</hi> 14. Juſtified is the ſame with Pardoned. I anſwer, This place ſhews that Juſtification follows upon true Repentance, but not that Juſtification and Pardon are the ſame; the Satisfaction of Chriſt juſtifies a Sinner, a Pardon only frees him from puniſhment. To name but one place more; The Free-gift is of many offences to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom,</hi> 5.16. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Free-gift, ſeems here to import Pardon, as if Pardon and Juſtification were all one. To this I anſwer; The Apoſtle in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous place ſets down a Parallel between the two Heads, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt; Adam</hi>'s Sin and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs; <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin making us Sinners unto death, and Chriſt's Righteouſneſs making us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto Life. But the word (Pardon or Remiſſion) is not ſo much as once named in all the Parallel; by the Free-gift <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. is not meant Remiſſion, but Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. This is clear upon a double account: the one is this; The Free-gift is oppoſed to <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and that which in this Parallel is oppoſed to <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, muſt needs be Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; this appears throughout the whole Parallel, in the 15, <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. <hi>Verſ. Adam</hi>'s Sin and the Free-gift are oppoſed; in the 18. <hi>Verſ. Adam</hi>'s Offence and Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs are oppoſed; in the 19. <hi>Verſ. Adam</hi>'s Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Chriſt's Obedience are oppoſed: Hence it appears, that what is the Free-gift in the 15, and 16. <hi>Verſ.</hi> is the Righteouſneſs or Obedience of Chriſt
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:60626:173"/>in the 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. <hi>Verſ.</hi> neither indeed can the Parallel ſtand, if any other thing than <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be oppoſed to <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin. The other is this; theſe words, The Free-gift, are put inſtead of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs or Obedience; this appears in that, where the one is mentioned, the other is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in the 15, 16, 17. <hi>Verſ.</hi> The Free-gift is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the Righteouſneſs or Obedience of Chriſt is omitted; in the 18, and 19. <hi>Verſ.</hi> the Righteouſneſs and Obedience of Chriſt is mentioned, but the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift is omitted. Indeed in our Tranſlation we have the Free-gift <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. but not in the Original. Hence it appears that they are the ſame; I ſuppoſe that in the 18. <hi>Verſ.</hi> ſhould be otherwiſe ſupplied: Thus it appears that the Free-gift is not Pardon. Having ſeen the moſt material Texts; I ſhall obſerve one thing more: Juſtification is ſet forth in ſuch a way in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that it muſt needs be diſtinct from Pardon: It is ſet forth ſo, that the Law is eſtabliſhed by it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. but the Law is not eſtabliſhed by a Pardon, but by a Satisfaction. You will ſay, Our Pardon is upon a Satisfaction; but if that Satisfaction do not juſtifie us, if it be no Ingredient in our Juſtification; then in our Juſtification the Law is not eſtabliſhed as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; Juſtification is ſet forth ſo, that the Righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. But the Righteouſneſs of the Law is not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in a Pardon; neither is it fulfilled in our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, though ſincere Obedience: The <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is, as <hi>Ariſtotle ſaith,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">Eth. l. <hi>5.</hi> cap. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Correctio injuriae,</hi> Satisfaction for the injured Law, but nothing is ſuch but Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. The Apoſtle in the precedent Verſe ſaith, That ſin was condemned in the Fleſh of Chriſt; and of this, there
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:60626:174"/>is a double Fruit; firſt Juſtification: The Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law is fulfilled in us; that is, Chriſt's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction becomes imputatively ours, and then San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; we walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit: This Interpretation harmonizes with the firſt Verſe; ther firſt we have Juſtification, There is no Condemnation to them who are in Chriſt; and then Sanctification, We walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit; as therefore Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is the only thing which ſatisfies the Law, ſo it is the only ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying matter againſt it: Juſtification is ſo ſet forth, that the Law hath its end: Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, Rom.</hi> 10.4. as he is the end of the Law, ſo he is for Righteouſneſs; he is not the end of the Law in a procured pardon, but in a Satisfaction made and applied; Juſtification therefore conſiſts not in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but in a Satisfaction applied and made ours by Imputation. Thus far out of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Juſtification cannot be without a Righteouſneſs; that God (who judgeth according to truth, who is Juſt, and a Juſtifyer) doth not eſteem or pronounce us righteous unleſs we are ſo; a pardon is not our Righteouſneſs; for that is God's Act, and God's Act, though it may make or eſteem us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, is not it ſelf our Righteouſneſs, neither is that, which a pardon gives, <hi>viz.</hi> an immunity from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; ſuch an immunity from puniſhment, which is, <hi>ex merâ indulgentiâ,</hi> as in the caſe of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned Malefactor, is not ſuch; the Malefactor in that caſe is treated in point of puniſhment as a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous Man, but he is not ſuch indeed, his plea is only a pardon, he is free only <hi>à paenâ,</hi> not <hi>à culpâ,</hi> the Judge doth not eſteem him as righteous, but as one
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:60626:174"/>exempt from puniſhment; nay, an immunity, which is <hi>ex Juſtitiâ,</hi> as in the caſe of an innocent perſon, though it ſuppoſe a Righteouſneſs in him, yet it is no more it ſelf a righteouſneſs than in the other caſe; it is diſtinct from his Righteouſneſs as a conſequent is from its antecedent: Now if a pardon or immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from puniſhment be not our Righteouſneſs, then Chriſt's Righteouſneſs (which was penal and obediential to an infinite value, and did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate the very <hi>culpâ,</hi> and free us from it) is, as ſoon as it is made ours by Imputation, our Righteouſneſs againſt the Law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If a pardon might be called Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is but improperly ſuch; there are then as (I will ſuppoſe for Diſcourſe ſake) three ſorts of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be diſtinguiſhed, one by the <hi>idem,</hi> the very ſame perfect Righteouſneſs, which the Law calls for, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the <hi>tantundem,</hi> a Righteouſneſs which is a plenary ſatisfaction to the broken Law; a third by Remiſſion only: the firſt is more ſtrictly Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation than the ſecond, becauſe the very Letter of the Law is fulfilled in it, which it is not in the other; the ſecond is more properly Juſtification than the third, becauſe there is a plenary compenſation to the Law in it; when in the other there is nothing but a meer condonation: the third is the moſt improper Juſtification of all the reſt, becauſe it communicates not Righteouſneſs, but an Indulgence: Now in our caſe, had there been no ſatisfaction at all, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, if poſſible, muſt have ſtood in remiſſion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but a great and glorious ſatisfaction being made, it ſeems very ſtrange, that Juſtification ſhould conſiſt only in the leſs proper, in remiſſion, which frees us <hi>à paenâ,</hi> whilſt the proper, Chriſt's Satisfaction, which
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:60626:175"/>in a way of compenſation, frees us <hi>à culpâ,</hi> is waved: It is true, it is not totally waved; it is allowed to be an antecedent meritorious cauſe of Juſtification, but being no Ingredient in it, Juſtification ſtill conſiſts in the leſs proper, while the more proper in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is waved.</p>
               <p>Before I paſs on, I muſt conſider one objection; pardon takes away <hi>reatum penae,</hi> the obligation to puniſhment, and what more can be done to a ſinner? ſtill the <hi>reatus culpae</hi> abides, the fault will be a fault; the Sinner a Sinner; that is, one who ſinned; and if no more can be done to a ſinner, why is not immunity from puniſhment, his Righteouſnes, or what can be Righteouſneſs if that be not ſo?</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this great Objection, I ſhall offer two or three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is indeed a rule of reaſon, that, <hi>factum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum fieri non poteſt;</hi> yet it is worthy the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Learned, whether the <hi>culpâ,</hi> which ever continues <hi>in facto,</hi> in it ſelf may not yet ceaſe <hi>in jure,</hi> ſo far as not to redound upon the Perſon to make him culpable? I ſhall only mention one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſo leave it; the Bleſſed Virgin, not being, as her Son was, conceived of the Holy Ghoſt, was no doubt fubject to Original Sin, that put a <hi>culpâ</hi> upon every part of her, and <hi>factum infectum fieri non poteſt.</hi> Nevertheleſs, when the Word was made Fleſh; when his Body was framed out of the Subſtance of the Virgin, no <hi>culpâ</hi> did remain, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound upon his Humane Nature, much leſs upon his Sacred Perſon which aſſumed it: in Sacred Myſteries we muſt not be too peremptory upon our reaſon, but ſpeak with all caution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.</p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:60626:175"/>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Beatus culpae,</hi> or guilt of fault, may be conſidered under a double notion, either in it ſelf, in its intrinſecal deſert of puniſhment, or elſe in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy upon the ſinner, which conſiſts in three things. Firſt, it ſo redounds upon him as to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate him a ſinner, that is, one who hath ſinned; then it ſo redounds as to make him continue worthy of puniſhment; and again it ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds, as actually to oblige him to puniſhment: Now the <hi>reatus</hi> in its ſelf, in its intrinſecal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, muſt needs be perpetual, becauſe ſin cannot ceaſe to be ſin, the denominating him a ſinner, one who hath ſinned, muſt be perpetual too, becauſe <hi>factum infectum fieri non poteſt:</hi> but, as I take it, that redundancy which makes him worthy of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is removed in Juſtification, and that which actually obliges him to puniſhment, is removed in remiſſion; it is uſually ſaid in the Schools, <hi>tranſit actus, manet reatus,</hi> after the Act of Sin is paſſed and gone, the guilt abides; we may ſay of the ſinner, that he hath ſinned <hi>in praeterito,</hi> nay, and <hi>in praeſenti,</hi> that he is <hi>filius mortis,</hi> worthy to die, and ſuffer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but after he hath received the great atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after Chriſt's ſatisfaction (which is more than an <hi>aequipondium</hi> to his unworthineſs) is Imputed and made over to him, he continues no longer worthy of puniſhment; the ſin it ſelf is worthy of it, but he is not; he was once worthy of it, but now he is no longer ſo. I cannot imagine, that Chriſt's <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>or worthy ones, Rev.</hi> 3.1. ſhould remain <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>worthy of Death, Rom.</hi> 1.32. Or that the pure Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhould be inhabited by ſuch as ſtill continue worthy of Hell: Chriſt's Righteouſneſs ſo much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighs and counterpoiſes the <hi>meritum paenae</hi> that is
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:60626:176"/>in ſin, that though the worthineſs of puniſhment cannot be ſeparated from the ſin it ſelf, yet it ceaſes to redound upon the ſinner, as ſoon as he believes and hath an intereſt in that Righteouſneſs: Its true, the ſinner as he is in himſelf, is worthy of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but as he is in Chriſt, a part or Member of him, a participant of his Satisfaction, he is not worthy thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If we look diſtinctly upon a ſatisfaction, or plenary compenſation for ſin of the one hand, and upon a pardon, or immunity from puniſhment of the other, it will be eaſily ſeen where our Righteouſneſs lies, and what is our juſtifying Plea and matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law; a pardon frees from puniſhment, but a Satisfaction ſalves the honour of the broken Law, repairs the damage done to it, compenſates for the violations of it, and comes in the Room of that perfect conformity which the Law did primarily aim at: in this therefore, not in the other ſtands our Righteouſneſs as to the Law. Thus much touching my fifth Reaſon, that Juſtification conſiſts not in a pardon.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Chriſt ſuffered <hi>noſtro loco,</hi> in our place and ſtead; thoſe pregnant Scriptures (that he gave his Life a ranſom <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the ſtead of many, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. that he gave himſelf <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize for all, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. that he ſuffered the juſt for the unjuſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.) are no cold improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but full proofs of it; he did <hi>ſuſtinere noſtram perſonam, ſuſtein our perſon in his ſufferings;</hi> there was a double commutaton, his perſon was put in the room of our perſons, and his ſufferings in the room of our ſufferings; he that ſatisfies for another, muſt do it <hi>nomine debitoris,</hi> he that
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:60626:176"/>pays in his own name, cannot ſatisfie for another. When our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Peter, That give</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>for me and thee, Matth.</hi> 17.27. if <hi>Peter</hi> had paid it only in his own name, he could not have ſatisfied for his Maſter. In like manner, if Chriſt had ſuffered only in his own Name, he could not have ſatisfied for <hi>Peter</hi> or any other: The Debt which he ſatisfied for was ours, not his; he ſtood as our Repreſentative, and ſatisfied for us; he did not only ſuffer <hi>noſtro bono,</hi> that the profit might be ours, but <hi>noſtro loco,</hi> that the Satisfaction it ſelf might be ours; nevertheleſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Divine Conſtitution; that is, that it might be ours; not immediately, but as ſoon as we become Members of him; not according to the full latitude, but according to the capacity of Members; not to all intents, but that it might be the matter of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification as to the Law.</p>
               <p>Having laid down my Reaſons, I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to anſwer the Objections made againſt Imputed Righteouſneſs; only here I muſt remember the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of one thing. Let him not think that there are no Myſteries in our Religion, as if all there were within the line of Humane Reaſon: There are Super-rational Myſteries in Chriſt's perſon; mortal and immortal, temporal and eternal, the Creature and the Creator; do in an ineffable manner meet together in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and why may there not be ſuch in Chriſt My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical too? The union between Chriſt and Believers is a great Myſtery, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.32. and the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Righteouſneſs to them, which enſues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that union, hath too much of Myſtery in it to be meaſured by Humane Reaſon. <hi>Proclus</hi> ſaid well, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <q>Why doſt thou reproach Divine things with Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings?</q>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:60626:177"/>Reaſon is no competent Judge of ſuch matters.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>An Accident cannot be removed from its ject: Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is an accident.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> An Accident cannot be removed from its Subject, ſo as to have a novel inheſion; but it may be transferred by a juſt Imputation. I ſhall give two inſtances of this: <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin was imputed unto us; if not, then, as I have before proved, there can be no ſuch thing as original ſin, the Doctrine of which hath been owned by the Church in all Ages: Again, our ſin was imputed unto Chriſt, elſe his ſufferings could not be penal; the Scripture is emphatical, he was made Sin for us, 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all,</hi> Eſa. 53.6. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, that he was <hi>delictorum ſuſceptor, non commiſſor.</hi> St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaith, <hi>non de coelis attulit, ſed de nobis aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpſit:</hi> if our ſin was not at all imputed to him, his ſufferings could not be penal: To clear this, I ſhall firſt prove that Chriſts ſufferings were penal in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſence, and then, that they could not be ſuch without ſin imputed: Firſt, Chriſt's ſufferings were penal; in Scripture we find, that our ſins were born in his body, and condemned in his fleſh, that he was wounded and bruiſed for them, that he was made a curſe for us; all which ſpeak penal ſufferings: If his ſufferings were not penal, how were they ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? a proper ſatisfaction can hardly be proved from an improper puniſhment. How did he ſuffer in our ſtead; If he did, it was in a no-puniſhment, which is all one, as if <hi>Archelaus</hi> had reigned in the room of his Father in a No-kingdom: what <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample was there in his ſufferings to deterr us from ſin? There is no ſuch thing in ſufferings not penal:
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:60626:177"/>what demonſtration of Juſtice was there in them? in ſufferings not penal power may appear, but juſtice cannot: We ſee here his ſufferings were penal, but without ſin imputed how could they be ſo? <hi>Socinus</hi> (who would not have them penal, leſt they ſhould be ſatisfactory too ſaith, that Chriſt died, <hi>quia ita &amp; Deo &amp; ipſi viſum eſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deſerv. l. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe ſo it ſeemed good to God and him: but would this make his ſufferings penal? no, he intended no ſuch thing, neither will this do it; God's meer Will may inflict ſufferings, but nothing but Juſtice can inflict puniſhment. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, unleſs moved, inflicts it not; neither is there any other mover, but that of ſin imputed. Where no ſin is imputed, there it is, as to puniſhment, all one as if there were no ſin; and where there is no ſin at all, there can be no ſuch thing as puniſhment: We are therefore under a neceſſity to ſay, that ſin was <hi>in tantum,</hi> ſo far imputed to Chriſt as to render his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings penal, and withal we ſee an accident paſſing to another by imputation; only here it will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that ſin was only imputed to Chriſt in the effects; but, I take it, this ſuffices not; for the effect of ſin is puniſhment; and puniſhment cannot be, where no ſin is imputed; a puniſhment without a why or a wherefore, is a puniſhment for nothing; that is, it is no puniſhment; and where there is no puniſhment, ſin is not ſo much as imputed in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. So that if it be imputed in the effect, it ſelf muſt be ſo far imputed, as to render the ſufferings penal, which makes good the inſtance.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>If</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Righteouſneſs be indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, then it is imputed in the full latitude; we are reputed by God to have ſatisfied Divine Juſtice, we are then imputatively our own Saviours and Redeemers;
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:60626:178"/>Nay, as</hi> Bellarmine <hi>ſaith,</hi> Redemptores &amp; Salvato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Mundi, <hi>Redeemers and Saviours of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If this Principle, That all Imputation is in the full latitude, be true, I yeild up the cauſe for ever. I am ſure I am not my own Saviour or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; I never ſatisfied Divine Juſtice for my ſins; but that this Principle is not true, I ſhll endeavour to manifeſt. Non-imputation and Imputation muſt needs have the ſame Rules to be governed by: this, I ſuppoſe, muſt not be denied by thoſe who ſay, That the Non-imputation of ſin, is the Imputation of Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1. Sin is not imputed to Believers: But how what, totally and in every reſpect? No, ſurely; ſtill the <hi>culpa</hi> abides, the ſin will be a ſin, the Sinner a Sinner; that is, one who ſinned; but it is not imputed as to puniſhment: If Sin may be Non-imputed in ſome reſpects, then Righteouſneſs may be imputed in a limited ſence alſo; if all Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be in the full latitude, then there is no Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a thing at all (ſave only to the proper doer of it) neither according to Principles of meer Nature, nor according to Principles of Juſtice, nor yet accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Divine Conſtitution: Not according to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of meer Nature; according to theſe ſin inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the Will is imputed to the Members of the Body, as being in conjunction with the Soul; elſe the Body ſhould not riſe and ſuffer for it: But how is it imputed? what, in the full latitude? Doth God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that the ſin properly did iſſue from the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and reſide there? It is not true, or poſſible, yet in a lower and diminutive manner is it to them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; nor according to Principles of Juſtice; our ſin (and that, as but now was proved) not in the effect only, but in ſome ſence in it ſelf, was imputed to
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:60626:178"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and that upon Principles of Juſtice, upon his Sponſion to ſatisfie for us, our ſin was imputed to him; but what in the full latitude? what to make as if there were a ſpot or turpitude in the Holy one? as if he by his own ſinful commiſſions had deſerved penal ſufferings? No, by no means; but in the leaſt reſpect that could poſſibly be, in no other reſpect than this, <hi>viz.</hi> So far as to render his ſufferings penal. Nor yet according to the Divine Conſtitution; this is moſt proper to the preſent caſe. And for this I muſt bring forth the Parallel of the two <hi>Adams,</hi> becauſe there never were any two ſuch Heads as theſe: <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, as I have before proved, was imputed to us; but what, in its full latitude? Were we the Head of Mankind? did we uſher in Sin and Death upon the World, as <hi>Adam</hi> did? No: This was by one <hi>Adam;</hi> but in a lower meaſure, and according to the capacity of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; it came upon us, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> well expreſſes it, <hi>Eo modo, quo communicari poteſt id quod tranſit, nimirum per imputationem;</hi> it came upon us <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> after the action done; <hi>Interpretativè</hi> and by way of reception, it only ſo far redounded upon us, as by that ſin to make us ſinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. In like manner, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is imputed to us; but what, in its full latitude? were we the Saviours or Redeemers of the World? did we uſher in Life and Righteouſneſs upon the Church? No; This was by one Chriſt; but in a lower meaſure, and according to the capacity of Members; it comes upon us only by Imputation, and <hi>Interpretativè,</hi> it only ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds upon us, as by that Righteouſneſs to make us righteous againſt the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. Theſe things being laid down, it appears, that the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to us doth not imply

In the firſt reſpect it is common for all, ſo far as to render them juſtifiable on Goſpel terms: In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond it is peculiarized to Believers; In the firſt it founds the promiſes of juſtification by Chriſt's blood, in the ſecond it executes them, and (which is as eaſily conceiveable as the other) in the firſt it is a meritorious cauſe of juſtification; in the ſecond a material.</p>
               <p>Having anſwered theſe Objections, which I look upon as moſt material; I ſhall conclude as I began, that Chriſt's righteouſneſs, as it is a Satisfaction, is ſo far imputed to his believing members, as to be the matter of their juſtification: The Law in that point can ask no more of them than that ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; there is enough in that to anſwer for all their ſins.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have treated touching our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to the Law. I now come to ſpeak of our righteouſneſs as to the Goſpel; Chriſt's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs anſwers as to the Law of works: Faith an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers as to the terms of the Goſpel. <hi>Do this, or die,</hi> was ſatisfied by Chriſt's righteouſneſs: <hi>Believe and live;</hi> is anſwered by Faith. <hi>Chriſtus eſt imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Legis, Spirious eſt impletio Evangelii:</hi> Now here I ſhall firſt ſhew the neceſſity of this two-fold righteouſneſs; and then the connexion which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a neceſſity of this two-fold righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:60626:181"/>God at firſt made man a holy, righteous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and upon the fall, he ſet to his hand a ſecond time to lift up man out of the Chains of Sin and wrath, into a ſtate of Grace and Life eternal. God as Creator gave man a Law of perfect obedience ſuited to his primitive nature, and as it were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with the principles of it. God as Redeemer gave us a Law of Grace; in which there is as much abatement and condeſcention to our faln eſtate, as could comport with his own Holineſs and Majeſty: In the former God ſtood upon the higheſt terms of perfect ſinleſs obedience; in the latter he comes down to the loweſt terms imaginable: He will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie and ſave every one who by true Faith yields and reſigns himſelf up to the conditions of the Goſpel; where there are diſtinct Laws, there muſt be diſtinct righteouſneſſes to anſwer them: That which comes up to the condeſcending terms of the Goſpel: falls much ſhort of the high terms of the Law; That which ſatisfies the Law, is a thing of incomparably greater excellency than that which anſwers to the terms of the Goſpel: There are two diſtinct charges, or accuſations to be ſuppoſed; the one, that we are Sinners, ſuch as have broken the Law: The other, that we are Unbelievers, ſuch as have rejected the Goſpel: Here therefore muſt be diſtinct Plea's; To the Firſt, the Plea is Chriſt's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to diſcharge us from the Law: To the Second, the Plea is Faith, which is the condition of the Goſpel. To the charge of final unbelief it is no Plea to ſay, that Chriſt hath ſatisfied; to the charge of being a ſinner, the Plea doth not conſiſt in Faith it ſelf; but in its object, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's Satisfaction: The righteouſneſſes themſelves are of different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:60626:182"/>as to the Law our righteouſneſs is without us, in the glorious Satisfaction of Chriſt made ours by a gracious imputation; as to the Goſpel, our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is within us, in that Faith which complies with the Evangelical terms; as to the Law, our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is not the <hi>idem,</hi> but a ſatisfaction made for the breaches of it; as to the Goſpel, our Faith is the very <hi>idem</hi> which the Goſpel condition calls for. It is of great concern in Juſtification, to place theſe two righteouſneſſes in their proper Orbes; if either of them be carried out of their own Sphear, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is ſubverted. As to the Law, Chriſt's Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is our only righteouſneſs, it is true; Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Atonement, but neither Faith, nor any other inherent Grace can here be our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. All theſe have their ſpots of imperfection; how faltring is our Faith? how cold our charity? how much is there wanting in all our graces? all are but in part, not in their full meaſure; but in their firſt lineaments: Neither do they dwell alone, but there is a ſad inmate of corruption under the ſame Roof: All theſe muſt paſs <hi>ſub veniâ,</hi> under a pardon, and under the Wings of Chriſt; theſe are not able to cover their own blots and imperfections; theſe therefore are not our Saviours or Redeemers; theſe do not ſatisfie the Law; theſe do not compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate for ſin; theſe do not come in the room of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience; neither can the true God, though one of infinite mercy, accept them as ſuch: No, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Chriſt's Satisfaction can here be our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Hence the Apoſtle having proved, that all the world is guilty before God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after adds, <hi>but now the righteouſneſs of God is manifeſted, v.</hi> 21. Where by the righteouſneſs of God;
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:60626:182"/>that of Chriſt muſt needs be meant; for that, and that only is proper and appoſite to anſwer that charge of the Law, which makes us guilty before God; that was a <hi>Salvo</hi> to the honour of the Law; that was a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary compenſation for the breaches of it; that came in the room of perfect Obedience; that therefore is the only, thing which could anſwer that charge: if we bring in Faith. or any other Grace into this Orb, we ſet them up as Chriſt's or Saviours; and in effect we ſay, that Chriſt died in vain.</p>
               <p>As to the Goſpel, Faith anſwers to the terms of it; here Chriſt's Satisfaction doth not ſupply the room: It's true, he ſatisfied for us, but he did not repent or believe for us; for then he ſhould have left nothing for us to do; no, not ſo much as to accept of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Satisfaction made for us. His Satisfaction was not to ſpare, but by its ſuperexcellent fulneſs to draw out our Faith to it ſelf; his atoning. Blood was not to excuſe, but upon a view of his Wounds to provoke our repentant Tears; he died not for our ſins, that we might live in them; his pure Fleſh was not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that our corrupt Fleſh might be ſpared. The Son of God came not down from Heaven to open a door to wickedneſs, but to promote a deſign of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: it is therefore we who muſt, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace, repent and believe: Faith muſt keep its Station, or elſe Holineſs, which is the great Deſign of the Goſpel, muſt be over-turned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The connexion between theſe two Righteouſneſſes is to be conſidered; in this connexion lies the total ſum of Juſtification. Chriſt's Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction anſwers to the Law; Faith anſwers to the terms of the Goſpel; Believers, who are righteous to both, cannot but be in a very bleſſed condition; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:60626:183"/>it is to be noted (as Learned Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath obſerved) Faith is but a particular Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a Righteouſneſs <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> only as to the performance of the Evangelical condition; but Chriſt's Satisfaction is an Univerſal Righteouſneſs as to all other things, ſave only that performance, for the final neglect of which he never died: Faith is a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as to the Evangelical condition; yet it is but a Righteouſneſs <hi>propter aliud,</hi> a Righteouſneſs ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate and ſubſervient to that great Righteouſneſs of Chriſt's Satisfaction, to make us capable to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate thereof. In this connexion we have an heap of Myſteries ſet before us; Juſtice is ſatisfied by a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary compenſation for ſin; Mercy is exalted, in that we, though Sinners, are juſtified upon terms on our part as low as the Holy one could poſſibly condeſcend unto; the great thing, the Satisfaction, which no Man, no Angel could accompliſh, was from Jeſus Chriſt; who being God in the Fleſh, was able to perform it; the comparatively little thing, I mean Faith, which our fallen Nature through Grace might arrive at, was that which was required at our hands; Satisfaction, which we could not have in our ſelves, we have in another, even in Chriſt our Sponſor: Faith, which we have in our ſelves, is that capacity whereby we are made meet to have that Satisfaction communicated to us; the Satisfaction which I think is the Righteouſneſs of God in Scripture mentioned, is communicated to us; yet, as infinite Wiſdom or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, it is communicated to us in the loweſt poſture of the Creature; I mean when we are by Self-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptying and Self-annihilating, Faith yielding and reſigning up our ſelves to the terms of the Goſpel; Faith, which is ſubjectively ours, is that capacity
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:60626:183"/>wherein we receive Chriſt's Satisfaction; that Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the Glory and Plenitude is only his; yet, as the Sun hangs down his Beams to the lower World, it derives it ſelf upon each Believer, <hi>pro ratione mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri:</hi> I mention the Sun, becauſe the Prophet tells us, That upon thoſe that fear God's Name, <hi>The Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſes with Healing in his Wings;</hi> a choice part of which Healing I take to be in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of his Satisfaction to us, that only heals the deadly Wound of Guilt which is upon us. In Chriſt's Righteouſneſs there is a Merit to procure Faith; in Faith there is a capacity to have that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs made ours; in that Righteouſneſs there is that which covers the imperfections of Faith. Thus there is an admirable connexion between theſe two Righteouſneſſes: Further touching our Juſtification as to the terms of the Goſpel, we muſt firſt conſider, what that Faith, by which we are juſtified, is; and then how we are juſtified by it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Faith whereby we are juſtified, is not Reaſon in its own Sphere converſing about God and his Goodneſs, but it is totally ſupernatural; ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural in its Principle; it is the Gift of God: and, as the ſecond <hi>Aranſican</hi> Councel tells us, It is <hi>per inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem Spiritûs ſancti, Can.</hi> 6. Supernatural in its object, it is fixed in a God in Covenant, and in his Grace. It hangs upon Chriſt and his Sweet-ſmelling Sacrifice. It falls in with ſupernatural promiſes of Grace and Glory: neither is this Faith a meer naked aſſent, which may be in wicked Men; nay, and in Devils; but it is that which receives Chriſt, and feeds upon him, eating his Fleſh, and drinking his Blood unto Life Eternal: <hi>Vitam à Vitae Fonte haurimus, &amp; in ipſum quaſi totos. nos immergimus,</hi> ſaith Biſhop <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;</hi>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:60626:184"/>We draw Life from the Fountain of Life, and wholly drown our ſelves in him: True Faith takes the Divine objects propoſed, not by piece-meal, but in their entireneſs; it is not meerly for God's Grace, that Hony-comb of infinite ſweetneſs; but for his Holineſs too, that the Soul may be more and more transformed and aſſimilated to the Divine Image and likeneſs. Faith very well knows, That no Man, who by his rebellions ſtrikes at his Holineſs, can poſſibly lean on his Grace: ſo to do, is not to believe, but to preſume and truſt in a lye: Faith is for all Chriſt; not only for a meriting and atoning Chriſt, but for a teaching and ruling one: it knows that Chriſt muſt not be mangled or torn in pieces; the Merit muſt not be divided from the Spirit; nor the Water from the Blood; theſe muſt ever be in conjunction; an half Chriſt is not the Chriſt of God, but a Chriſt of his own fancy, ſuch as cannot profit us; Faith is not meerly for Promiſes, which are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, and Pots of <hi>Manna,</hi> but for Precepts too; it is Meat and Drink to doe the Will of God; Promiſes and Precepts run together in Scripture; Promiſes are the effluxes of Grace, and Faith takes them into the heart by recumbency; Precepts are effluxes of Holineſs, and Faith takes them in by an Obediential Subjection; both are owned by Faith, and muſt be ſo as long as there is Grace and Holineſs in God; Faith cannot ſtand without repentance; it truſts in Infinite Mercy: and an impenitent one, who ſtill holds up his Arms of Rebellion, cannot do ſo; it reſts upon the Merits and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and an impenitent one, who tramples under foot the atoning Blood, cannot do ſo. It hath a reſpect for the holy Commands; and the impenitent, who by willful ſinning caſts them away, and as much as in him lieth, makes them void,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:60626:184"/>can have no reſpect for them; there can no ſuch thing as an impenitent Faith: We ſee by theſe things what a Faith that is, by which we are juſtified.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The next thing is, How we are juſtified by Faith. Faith may be conſidered under a double notion; either as it reſpects Chriſt, or as it reſpects the condition of the Goſpel: As it reſpects Chriſt, it unites us to him; it makes us Members of his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body; thus it is a Sacred <hi>Medium</hi> to have Chriſt's Righteouſneſs imputatively become ours, that we may be juſtified againſt the Law; nothing can juſtifie us againſt it but Chriſt's Satisfaction; that cannot do it unleſs it become ours; ours it cannot be, unleſs we are Believers. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, That the Righteouſneſs of God is upon the Believer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. That Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to the Believer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. Here Faith doth not juſtifie us in it ſelf, but in its object, Chriſt; to whom it ſo unites us, that his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo far becomes ours, as to juſtifie us againſt the Law. As it reſpects the Condition of the Goſpel, it is the very thing which that Condition calls for; in the Law of Works the Condition and the Precept were coextenſive; the one was as large as the other; no Man could live by that Law, but he who had the perfect Obedience commanded in the Precept; but in the Law of Grace it is otherwiſe. The Precept hath more in it than the Condition; the Precept calls for Faith, not in its Truth only, but in its Statures and gradual Perfections; it would have us aſpire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a fiducial Liberty, a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion with full ſails towards the great things in the Promiſe, as if they were ſenſibly preſent with us; but the Condition calls only for a true Faith, and no
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:60626:185"/>more; the leaſt Faith, if true, though it be but as a little ſmoak or wick in the ſocket; though it be but a little ſpark or ſeed of Faith <hi>latent</hi> in a Deſire or Willing Mind; is performance of the Condition. Hence the poor in Spirit, who ſeem to themſelves to have nothing of Grace at all in them, have a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs entailed on them; which could not be, unleſs they had performed the Condition; woe would it be to Chriſtians, if all that is in the Precept were in the Condition alſo; if their Juſtification were ſuſpended till they had reached the top and higheſt altitude of the Precept; in reference to the Precept, Faith hath its Degrees and Statures; it comes up more or leſs to the Precept; but in reference to the Condition, Faith hath no Degrees, but ſtands in <hi>puncto indiviſibili;</hi> it hath no <hi>magis</hi> or <hi>minùs</hi> in it; the leaſt true Faith doth as much perform the Condition as the ſtrongeſt. <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciger</hi> who prayed thus, <hi>Invoco te, Domine, languidâ &amp; imbecillâ Fide, ſed Fide tamen,</hi> did as much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Condition, as he who hath the ſtrongeſt confidence in God's Mercy. The verity of Faith is all that the Condition calls for; theſe things, as I have learned from Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> being ſo, I conclude thus; as to the Precept, true Faith falls ſhort; it is not as it ought to be, it juſtifies not; nay, in reſpect of defects and imperfections, it ſelf wants to be juſtified and covered with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; but as to the Condition, it fully comes up; it is as it ought to be; it is in it ſelf the very thing required; it is in this point a particular Righteouſneſs, anſwering for us, That we have performed the Condition: Yet ſtill we muſt remember, that this particular Righteouſneſs is ſubordinate to Chriſt's Satisfaction, which is our univerſal Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:60626:185"/>
               <p>There is yet one thing behind, <hi>viz.</hi> To conſider how or in what Reſpect Obedience or Good Works are neceſſary unto Juſtification: I ſhall ſet down my thoughts in the following particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Our good Works do not come in the room of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to juſtifie us as to the Law; to ſecure this, the Apoſtle often concludes, That we are not juſtified by the Works of the Law; our good Works are full of imperfection; the pureſt of them come forth <hi>ex laeſo principio,</hi> out of an Heart ſanctified but in part; and in their egreſs from thence gather a taint and tincture from the in-dwelling ſin; never any Saint durſt ſtand before God in his own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Job,</hi> though perfect, would not know his own Soul, <hi>Job</hi> 9.21. <hi>David,</hi> though a Man after God's Heart, would not have him mark iniquities, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 130.3. <hi>Anſelm</hi> upon this account cries out, <hi>Terret me Vita mea,</hi> My own Life makes me afraid; all of it was in his Eyes ſin or barrenneſs; our Good Works did not, could not ſatisfie the Law; no, this was that which nothing but Chriſts Righteouſneſs could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh: We find not the Saints in Scripture ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their own bottom, but flying to a Mercy ſeat; and, as the expreſſion is, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12, 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off from themſelves unto Jeſus the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of their Faith, in whom alone perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is to be found.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Our Good Works have not the ſame ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Faith; this appears upon a double account; the one is this, Faith unites us to Chriſt. And ſo it is a Divine <hi>Medium</hi> to have his Righteouſneſs made ours; but Good Works follow after Union; we are by Faith married to Chriſt, that we might bring forth fruit to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. Before Faith, which
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:60626:186"/>is our Eſpouſal of Chriſt; we bring forth no genuine Obedience; Good Works are the progeny of a Man in Chriſt; one who by Union with him is rightly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited to do the Will of God: not of a Man in <hi>Adam,</hi> one who ſtands in the power of Nature: the other is this, In the very inſtant or firſt entrance into Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Faith is there, but ſo is not Obedience; a Believer, in the very inſtant of believing, before any Good Works ſpring up in his Life, hath a true title to the promiſes of the Goſpel; the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is upon him; the Spirit of Grace is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him; Obedience is a bleſſed fruit, which enſues upon theſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Obedience is neceſſary, though not to the firſt entrance into Juſtification, yet to the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it. Not indeed as a Cauſe, but as a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<note place="margin">De Juſt. Actual. fol. <hi>404.</hi>
                  </note> Thus Biſhop <hi>Davenant, Bona opera ſunt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaria ad Juſtificationis ſtatum retinendum &amp; conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandum; non ut cauſae, quae per ſe efficiant aut mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur hanc conſervationem; ſed ut media ſeu conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, fine quibus Deus non vult Juſtificationis Gratiam in hominibus conſervare.</hi> If a Believer, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly juſtified upon believing, would continue ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, he muſt ſincerely obey God. Though his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in meaſure and degree reach not fully to the Precept of the Goſpel; yet in truth and ſubſtance it comes up to the Condition of it; elſe he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue juſtified; this to me is very evident; we are at firſt juſtified by a living Faith, ſuch as virtually is O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; and cannot continue juſtified by a dead one, ſuch as operates not at all. We are at firſt juſtified by a Faith which accepts Chriſt as a Saviour and Lord; and cannot continue juſtified by ſuch a Faith as would divide Chriſt, taking his Salvation from guilt, and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:60626:186"/>by diſobedience caſting off his Lordſhip; could we ſuppoſe that which never comes to paſs, that a Believer ſhould not ſincerely obey: How ſhould he continue juſtified? if he continue juſtified, he muſt, as all juſtified perſons have, needs have a right to life eternal; and if he have ſuch a right, how can he be judged according to his works? no good works being found in him after his believing, how can he be adjudged to life? or how to death, if he continue juſtified? Theſe things evince, that obedience is a condition neceſſary as to our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in a ſtate of Juſtification: Nevertheleſs it is not neceſſary, that obedience ſhould be perfect as to the Evangelical precept; but that it ſhould be ſuch, that the truth of Grace, which the Evangelical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition calls for, may not fail for want of it: <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life; and may enter in through the gates into the City, Rev.</hi> 22.14. The firſt fundamental right to Heaven they have by the Faith of Chriſt only; but ſincere obedience is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that that right may be continued to them: In this ſence we may fairly conſtrue that concluſion of St. <hi>James, Te ſee then how that by works a man is juſtified, and not by Faith only. Jam.</hi> 2.24. Faith brings a man into a juſtified eſtate: But may he reſt here? No; his good works muſt be a proof of his Faith, and give a kind of experiment of the life of it: Nay, they are the Evangelical condition, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which his bleſſed eſtate of juſtification is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to him; <hi>in foro legis,</hi> Chriſt and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is all; neither our Faith nor our Works can ſupply the room of his Satisfaction to juſtifie us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law: But <hi>in foro gratiae,</hi> our obedience
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:60626:187"/>anſwers to the Evangelical condition, and is a means to continue our juſtified eſtate: It's true, St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts that we are juſtified by Faith, not by Works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. Which ſeems directly contrary to that of St. <hi>James,</hi> that a man is juſtified by Works, not by Faith only; but the difference is reconciled very fairly; if we do but conſider what the Works are in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and what they are in St. <hi>James:</hi> In St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Works are perfect Works, ſuch as corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond to the Law, ſuch as make the reward to be of Debt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. Hence <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, <hi>operantem vocat, qui ſuis meritis aliquid promeretur, non ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantem, cui nihil debetur operum merito:</hi> In St. <hi>James</hi> the Works are ſincere only, ſuch as anſwer not to the Law, but to the Evangelical condition; ſuch as merit not, but are rewarded out of meer Grace: Works in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are ſuch as ſtand in competition or coordination with Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, which ſatisfied the Law for us: Works in St. <hi>James,</hi> are ſuch as ſtand in due ſubordination to Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, and are required only as fruits of Faith, and conditions upon which we are to continue in a juſtified eſtate. Works in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are ſuch as no man can do; Nay, as no man muſt ſo much as imagine that he can do, unleſs he will caſt away Chriſt and Grace. Works in St. <hi>James</hi> are ſuch as muſt be done, or elſe we prove our ſelves hypocrites, and our Faith dead and vain; in both Apoſtles <hi>Abraham</hi> is brought in as an inſtance. In St. <hi>Paul</hi> the queſtion was, whether <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Sinner? and here the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt did juſtify him. In St. <hi>James</hi> the queſtion was, whether <hi>Abraham</hi> was a true Believer? and here his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence did prove him to be ſo, and did anſwer to the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:60626:187"/>Evangelical condition: theſe differences conſidered, it is eaſie to underſtand how we cannot be juſtified by good works in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſence; and yet how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. <hi>James</hi> good works are neceſſary to prove our Faith a living one; and to anſwer the condition of the Goſpel, that the ſtate of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, into which we entred by Faith, may be continued.</p>
               <p>To ſhut up this Diſcourſe touching Juſtification, we muſt here ſtand and adore the infinite Wiſdom and mercy of God in this great Work; what poor faln Creatures were we? into what an horrible gulf of ſin and miſery were we ſunk? whither could we turn? or how could we think ever to ſtand before the holy God? ſtorms of wrath hung over our heads, and might juſtly have fallen upon us; but how ſhould we be juſtified, or ever eſcape? Might the pure perfect Law be abrogated, that we might be acquitted? No, it could not be; it was immortalized by its own intrinſecal rectitude and equity: might God wave his holineſs and juſtice, that his mercy might be manifeſted upon us? would the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor pardon the Sin of a world without any recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence or Satisfaction? No, his Law is ſacred and honorable? Sin is no light or indifferent thing in his eyes: Where then ſhall a ſatisfaction be found; no Creature could poſſibly undertake it; no Man, no Angel could or durſt ſtart ſuch a thought, as that one of the Sacred Trinity ſhould do it: See then and admire this incomparable work; the Son of God, very God, leaves his Fathers boſom, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes our frail fleſh; in it fulfills all righteouſneſs; and at laſt is made Sin and a Curſe for us, that we might be juſtified and pardoned: No ſooner are we
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:60626:188"/>by Faith in Union with him, but his righteouſneſs is upon us, his blood waſhes away all our guilt; through him we (but vile worms in our ſelves) become no leſs than Sons of God, and Heirs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: What are we, that ſuch things as theſe ſhould be made known to us? that Heaven ſhould open and let down ſuch myſteries before our eyes? What manner of perſons ought we to be, who live in the ſhining days of the Goſpel; who have ſo much of the Divine glory breaking out upon us? let us a little ſit down and conſider how infinite is the malignity of Sin, how deep the ſtain of it; when God, who cannot <hi>nugas agere,</hi> made ſuch ado about the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of it; when nothing leſs than the Blood of his own Son could waſh it out? Now to have ſlight thoughts of it, is to Blaſpheme the great Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; now to indulge it, is to rake in the wounds of Chriſt, and Crucify him afreſh to our ſelves: How precious ſhould Chriſt be to us? how altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lovely? what a Perſon is the Eternal Word? what an Union is Immanuel, God and Man in one? what a Laver is his Blood? what a ſweet-ſmelling Sacrifice is his Death? who can tell over the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable riches of his merit, or ſet a rate high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough upon that righteouſneſs of his, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhes the heart of God and Man? what a Sponſor was he, who ſatisfied infinite Juſtice for the Sin of a World? and what an excellent head, who makes his Righteouſneſs reach down to every Believer in the World? who would not now ſay, that he is <hi>totus deſideria,</hi> altogether loves and deſires? what little things are Worlds and Creatures? what Droſs and Dung in compariſon? what a wretched thing is a dead and frozen heart, which will not warm
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:60626:188"/>and take fire at ſo raviſhing an Object? Who would now live in the old <hi>Adam,</hi> the head of Sin and Death, any longer? or content himſelf in any ſtate ſhort of an Union with Chriſt, in whom Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Life are to be had? O how ſhould we act our Faith upon him, and give him the glory of his Righteouſneſs and Satisfaction by believing? How ſhould we venture our Souls, what ever our Debts are, upon the great Surety? Who paid the utmoſt Farthing, and had a total diſcharge in his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: How we ſhould hide our ſelves in the Clefts of the Rock, in the precious wounds of Chriſt as in a City of refuge; where the avenging Law, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied therein, can never purſue and overtake us? How willing ſhould we now be, to have Chriſt reign over us? What! hath he come from Heaven, and in our fleſh fulfilled all Righteouſneſs; and by his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto Death, even the death of the Croſs, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for our ſins, and turned away the dreadful wrath due to the ſame, and ſhall he not Reign over us? Hath he bore the heavy end of the Law; the ſinleſs obedience which we could not perform, and the curſe; which, if we had been under, would have ſunk us down into Hell for ever, and ſhall he not Reign over us? when by a condeſcending Law of Grace ſuited to our frailty, he calls for nothing from us but ſincerity: Oh! prodigious ingratitude! who would be guilty of it, or can be ſo, that is a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver indeed? Let us therefore by Faith joyn our ſelves to Chriſt, that we may be juſtified by his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and as a real proof of it, let us reſign up our ſelves in ſincere obedience to him; that having our fruit unto holineſs, we may have the end everlaſting Life.</p>

Juſtification and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication are ever in conjunction, as in God Juſtice and Holineſs: In Chriſt the Prieſtly and Kingly Offices; in the Goſpel the Promiſes and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; and in the Sinner the Guilt and the Power of Sin are in Conjunction; ſo in Believers Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Sanctification are in Conjunction: Were this Conjunction diſſolved, the other could not well together conſiſt; the perſon being Juſtified and yet not Sanctified: Gods Juſtice muſt ſpare him, yet his
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:60626:189"/>Holineſs muſt hate him; Chriſt muſt ſatisfie and ſave him as a Prieſt, yet not command him as a King: The Promiſes muſt ſpeak comfort to him, yet are the Precepts broken by him; the guilt of Sin muſt be done away, yet the power and love of it muſt remain; but none of theſe can ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither can Juſtification ſtand without Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>

The great Titles of Creator and Redeemer proper to his God, will not ſuffer him to be ſo; it is no leſs than Sacriledge in his eyes to be his own, or ſo much as in a thought to ſteal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ought from God, to whom his Spirit, Soul, Body, all is due; his Reaſon is not his own, as one who knows it to be a borrowed light; he reſigns it up to God the Father of lights, to be illuminated by him, and to the holy myſteries, to be ruled by them, without asking any why's or wherefores; Thoſe two words, <hi>Deus Dixit,</hi> God ſaith, is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction

It is horrible preſumption in us to put by the New Creation, and think that the Old may ſerve the turn for an holy Life; I can as eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Fable, That there is in the Body a <hi>Luz,</hi> a little Bone never putrifying, from whence the Reſurrection begins, as that there is any thing left in fallen Man which in it ſelf may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Principle of Regeneration and holy Living; could there be any ſuch thing found in us, there would be no neceſſity of Grace, but of Nature only; a Creator we might praiſe, but a Redeemer we need not; our own Spirit may ſerve the turn, God's may be ſpared.</p>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:60626:191"/>
               <p>Secondly, An holy Life is the fruit of a renewed and regenerated Heart; it is the budding and bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming of a Divine Nature in us; in it a Man ſhews himſelf to be a Man off from the old ſtock of <hi>Adam,</hi> and to be ingraffed into Chriſt; and as a branch in him, to have Life and Spirit from him to dedicate and conſecrate himſelf unto a God. Without this New ſtate there can be no ſuch thing as an holy Life: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells the <hi>Pelagians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Contr. Jul. lib. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> thoſe enemies of Grace, That they were in their Doctrine <hi>Ruina morum,</hi> the ruin of good Life: For if you take away that Grace which makes the New Creatures, there can be no ſuch thing as an holy Life; that muſt ſtand upon ſome foundation, and in lapſed Nature there is, there can be no other but a New Creature. To ſhew this more fully, I ſhall lay dawn two things diſtinctly: The one is this, An unregenerate Man cannot lead an holy Life: The other is this, An holy Life iſſues out of a Principle of Regeneration. Theſe two will fully clear the Point.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing is, An unregenerate Man cannot lead an holy Life; I ſay not, That an unregenerate Man cannot become regenerate; but that an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Man, whilſt ſuch, cannot live holily; not that there is a natural impotency, a want of the Faculties of Underſtanding and Will; but that there is a Moral one, and in-dwelling corruption which renders him uncapable to attain to it. That of our Saviour, <hi>A corrupt Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit, Matth.</hi> 7.18. carries a great evidence of Reaſon in it; the Fruit cannot exceed the Tree; the effect will not be better than the procreant cauſe is; if an unregenerate Man be a corrupt Tree; if an holy Life be good Fruit, the one cannot proceed from the other. It is vanity
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:60626:192"/>and folly to expect Grapes from Thorns, or Figs from Thiſtles; and to look for an holy Life from an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Heart is no leſs: It is the Apoſtle's Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>They that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God, Rom.</hi> 8.8. By thoſe in the Fleſh is not meant the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, who, if any on Earth, do ſurely pleaſe him; but the Unregenerate: accordingly the Apoſtle oppoſes thoſe in the Fleſh, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. to thoſe in the Spirit, in whom the Holy Spirit dwells, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. That is, the Unregenerate to the Regenerate. Hence we may conclude thus, The Unregenerate are in the Fleſh, in their corrupt Nature; and becauſe ſuch, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God; they cannot live that holy Life which is grateful to him: Therefore the Apoſtle in this Chapter doth not only diſtinguiſh between the Regenerate and Unregenerate; the one being in the Spirit, and the other in the Fleſh; but between the acting of the one and of the other. The Regenerate or thoſe in the Spirit, are after the Spirit, and mind the things of the Spirit; the Unregenerate or thoſe in the Fleſh, are after the Fleſh, and mind the things of the Fleſh, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. We have here two diſtinct Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Actings; the Regenerate Nature acts in a way of Holineſs and Obedience; but the Old corrupt Nature acts in a way of ſin and wickedneſs; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Man be new made by Grace, it will continue to do ſo: neither need we wonder at it; the Proverb is no leſs rational than ancient, <hi>Wickedneſs proceedeth from the wicked,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.13. A Sinner ſtudies ſin, and hath it in the very frame of his Heart; he thirſts after it, and drinks it as water; he rejoyces in it, and makes a ſport at it; he is never ſo much in his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as when he is committing it: But in an holy Life there is nothing congruous or connatural to
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:60626:192"/>him; his carnal Mind is enmity againſt God; it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. His Will is contrary to God's; the way of Holineſs is a burden to him, too grievous to be born: and how can we expect that in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſtate he ſhould in the leaſt enter upon an holy Life? In all reaſon firſt there muſt be a Power or Divine Principle, and then an Act: it is unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and croſs to the Method of Wiſdom, that the beam ſhould preceed the Sun, or the Fruit the Root; that acts of Sence or Reaſon ſhould go before their Faculties; or that an holy Life ſhould be imagined to take place before that Divine Nature which is the vital Root of it.<note place="margin">De Concord. cap. <hi>13.</hi>

But alas! in the Unregenerate what Principles are there? can ought be found there which may tend to an holy Life? His Heart is impure through the many vile luſts which dwell there; his Conſcience is defiled through the many guilts which he hath contracted; his Faith is a vain Fancy or Preſumption, and not a Faith; and how can he live holily, or what Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hath he for it? There muſt be a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Power and the Act: And ſo there is in the Regenerate, between the Seed of God and the crop of Holineſs; between the holy Unction and the Odours of Good Works; But what proportion
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:60626:193"/>can be imagined between an unregenerate Heart, and an holy Life? An unregenerate Man, as he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in Scripture, is weak and without ſtrength; and what can he do towards it? He is unclean and polluted, and how can ſuch a thing as an holy Life proceed from him? He is dark, nay, darkneſs it ſelf, and how can he walk in the Light? He is dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and how can he live a Divine Life? He is a Stranger, nay, and an Enemy to God and his Law, and how can he walk with God, or comply with his Law? In an holy Life we walk in the Spirit, and ſhew forth the Vertues of God; and how can he walk in that, or ſhew forth that which he hath not? An holy Life points directly to Heaven as its center, but the Principles in a Carnal man tend to Hell and Death: Inſtead of bearing a Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Holineſs and Life eternal, they carry in them a black contrariety and oppoſition to both; I will only add one thing more; to ſay, That there may be an holy Life in one unregenerate, is a contradiction. The very light of Nature tells us, That God muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated in the Heart, and worſhipped <hi>purâ mente.</hi> In the Heathen Sacrifices the Prieſt firſt looked on the Heart, to ſee that it was right. The <hi>Perſians</hi> thought, that God regarded nothing but the Soul in the Sacrifice; God loves <hi>Spiritualitèr immolantes,</hi> thoſe that offer up the Spirit to him in every Duty; an holy Life, if it be ſuch in ſubſtance, and not in ſhadow only, muſt be from a pure Heart; and who can find ſuch an one in an unregenerate Man? Or if if it could be found there, what need could there be of Regenerating Grace? If an holy Life muſt be from a pure Heart, and ſuch an Heart cannot be in a Man unregenerate, then it is not at all poſſible that an holy
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:60626:193"/>Life ſhould be in him, till Regenerating Grace hath made his heart Right. It is ſaid of <hi>Amaziah,</hi> That <hi>He did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect Heart,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 25.2. In the firſt part of the Verſe his Obedience looks very fair and amiable; but in the latter part of it there is a black mark ſet upon it, to ſhew that it was not right: the like mark muſt be ſet upon all that ſeeming San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity which is in unregenerate Men.</p>
               <p>The next thing propoſed is this, An holy Life iſſues out of a Principle of Regeneration: The <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (who deny original ſin, and therefore cannot ſpeak cordially of Regeneration) do ſometimes ſpeak ſo blindly and perverſly of the Holy Spirit; as if they meant to confound an holy Life, and its Principle together. Thus <hi>Socinus, Chriſti Spiritus obedientia eſt,</hi> The Spirit of Chriſt is Obedience;<note place="margin">De Servat. par. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>

                  </note> either the mind of Man inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Chriſt's Doctrine, or elſe the Doctrine it ſelf; as being loth to own the Regenerating Spirit. But it is evident in Scripture, that an holy Life is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from Regeneration, and iſſues from it as a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Fruit thereof: Firſt God creates us in Chriſt, and then there is a Progeny of good Works; firſt he quickens and gives us a Spiritual Being, and then we walk, and live an holy Life; firſt there is a good Treaſure of Grace in the Heart, and then the good things are brought forth out of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.35. <hi>Ye have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or into which, you were delivered,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 6.17. Here we ſee whence an holy Life ſprings; the Goſpel was not only delivered to them, but by the Regenerating Spirit they were delivered into it,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:60626:194"/>and caſt into the holy Mould of it; and this was the true Reaſon of their Obedience in an holy Life: <hi>Of his own Will begat he us with the Word of Truth, that we ſhould be a kind of Firſt-fruits of his Creatures, Jam.</hi> 1.18. The Apoſtle in the precedent verſe ſhews us the infinite Sun or Fountain of all good things, and in this Verſe he gives us a famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Regeneration, oppoſing it to that concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence which is immediately before ſpoken of; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence is the Fountain of ſin, and ſo is Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holy Obedience; the very end of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that we might be a kind of Firſt-fruits of his Creatures, ſeparate from the World, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated unto God in an holy Life, living as thoſe who by Regenerating Grace are made a choice portion and peculiar People to him. It is obſerved by ſome Divines, That the Holy Patriarchs had barren Wives, that their Poſterity might ſhadow out the Church, which is not produced by the power of Nature, but of Grace; the end of which production is, that Fruit might be brought forth unto God in an Holy Life. The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors ſay, That God out of his great Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> added the Letter <hi>He</hi> to the Names of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Sarah.</hi> Hence that of the <hi>Cabaliſts, Abram non gignit, ſed Abraham; Sarai non parit, ſed Sarah:</hi> In alluſion to this, I may ſay, It is not the Humane Principles, but the Divine Nature (which Believers the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> partake of) that makes them bring forth the Fruits of an holy Life: We have this exemplified in a greater than <hi>Abraham,</hi> even in Jeſus Chriſt; he was firſt conceived of the Holy Ghoſt, and then gave us that incomparable Pattern of Holineſs in his excellent Life. Sutably, we are firſt ſupernaturally begotten to a Spiritual
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:60626:194"/>Being, and then we live an Holy life: <hi>He that San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth, and they who are Sanctified are all of one.</hi> Hebr. 2.11. Hence <hi>Camero</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">De Eccleſ. <hi>223.</hi>
                  </note> that between Chriſt and Believers there is a wonderful Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Nature: Both have an humane Nature San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the Holy Spirit; he was conceived by the Holy Spirit; they are regenerated by it, that they may live unto God: but to make this point the clearer, I ſhall conſider the two parts of the new Creature; that is, Faith, and Love: I call them ſo, becauſe the Apoſtle, who ſaith, <hi>Neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Gal.</hi> 6.15. ſaith alſo, <hi>Neither Circumciſion availeth, nor uncircumciſion, but Faith which worketh by Love, Gal.</hi> 5.6. intimating, that Faith and Love are two great parts of the new Creature: an holy Life flows from both theſe; Hence ſome Learned Divines obſerve, that the good Acts of Heathens have an eſſential de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in them, the good Acts of Believers have only a gradual defect; but the good Acts of Heathens have an eſſential one; in that they do not flow from Faith and Love, and ſo cannot Center in the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God; Therefore St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> retracts that Speech, wherein he ſaid,<note place="margin">Retr. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>3.</hi>

                  <hi>Philoſophos virtutis luce fulciſſe,</hi> that the Philoſophers did ſhine with the light of virtue: But to ſpeak diſtinctly of theſe two Graces.</p>
               <p>Firſt, An Holy Life-iſſues out of Faith; an holy Life is virtually in Faith, and proceeds actually from it; Faith ſees the commands of God to be, as they are, richly Engraven with the Stamps and Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Divine purity and equity; ſuch as Proclaim that God is in them of a truth, and that they are the very Counterpains of his Heart; and from hence
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:60626:195"/>it preſſes the Believer unto obedience, and ſecretly dictates, that theſe are the very Will of God, and muſt be done; <hi>Thy word is very pure, therefore thy Servant loveth it:</hi> Saith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.140. The Emphatical <hi>[therefore]</hi> in the Text cannot be practically underſtood by any thing but Faith; the Carnal Mind, which is enmity to God, would argue from the purity of the command to the hatred of it; but Faith, ſuch is its Divine Genius, argues from thence to Love and Obedience. It doth not only point out the Divine Authority which is ſtampt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the command, but ſhew the purity and rectitude which is there to attract us into our duty; and that we may do it in a free filial manner. Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives a free Spirit from Chriſt to make obedience eaſie and natural to us; a Man with his old Heart drudges in the ways of God, and brings forth du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as the Bond-woman did her Son, in a dead Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile manner; but when Faith comes, the commands are eaſie; and the Will is upon the Wheel, ready to move ſweetly and ſtrongly in compliance thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: The Believer is Spirited and new Natured for Obedience; his Heart is in a poſture to do the Will of God; every where Faith finds Arguments and Impulſives for it: Doth it look upon the Life of Chriſt? it immediately concludes, theſe are the ſteps of our dear Lord, and ſhall we not follow him? After whom ſhall we walk if not after him? It's true he walked in pure ſinleſs perfection, ſuch as we cannot reach; but the gracious Covenant hath ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our frailty, and made us ſure that ſincerity will be aceepted, and how can we deny it, or refuſe to comply with ſuch condeſcending Grace? Doth it look upon Chriſts wounds and bloody Death?
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:60626:195"/>theſe will caſt ſhame and confuſion upon an unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life: May any one imagine that our Saviour bore the Curſe and Wrath of God, that we might provoke it; or expiated our ſins at ſo dear a rate, as his own Blood and Life, that we might indulge them? who ſees not now that Sin is bloody, and holineſs amiable? and what eaſie terms are propoſed to us, when the Death and Curſe was only Chriſt's, and the ſincere Obedience is all that is required to be ours? Doth it look up for the Spirit, the purchaſe of Chriſt's death? We well know where that is to be found: the more we walk in the holy Commands and ways of God, the more are we like to have of the gales and Divine comforts of it; while we are obeying and doing the Will of God, that Spirit will uſher in aſſiſtances and Heavenly conſolations upon us; to give us an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental proof of that Promiſe, That the Holy Spirit is given to them that obey him: doth it look within the vail, to the Rivers of pleaſures and plenitudes of joy in Heaven, where pious Souls ſee Truth in the original, and drink good at the Fountain head? Nothing is more obvious than this, that an holy Life is the true way thither; who can rationally think that he can carry the blots and turpitudes of an impure Life into ſuch a place, or that any thing leſs than ſincere Obedience can make him meet to enjoy God and holy Angels there? nothing can be more vain than ſuch an imagination; as ſure as Heaven is Heaven, an holy Life muſt be the way thither: Thus we ſee what a mighty influence Faith hath into Holineſs; hence <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

To conclude this with that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, Hebr.</hi> 11.6. Therefore without Faith it is impoſſible to lead an holy Life, which is very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him.</p>
               <p>The next thing is, An holy Life iſſues out of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love; without this neither Heart nor Life can be right; not the Heart; the Will without Divine Love in it, is <hi>tota cupiditas,</hi> all concupiſcence, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out it ſelf to every vanity that paſſes by; not the Life; whatever good is done without that Love, is done <hi>ſervilitèr, non liberalitèr:</hi> whate ever is in the hand, it is not done out of choice; <hi>in animo non facit,</hi> his Will concurres not as it ought; in God's account it is as if it were not done at all: Love is the root of an holy Life, the ſummary of the Law; though the Precepts of the Law are many <hi>in diverſitate operis,</hi> in the diverſity of the Work, yet they are but one <hi>in radice Charitatis,</hi> in the root of Charity. True Love is <hi>Donum aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis in amatum;</hi> the Soul, being drawn and called out of it ſelf by the object loved, yields and ſurrenders up it ſelf thereunto; if thus we love God, there muſt needs be an holy Life: the Heart, when given up and conſecrated unto him, cannot chuſe but carry the Life with it. It would be a prodigy in Nature if the Heart ſhould go one way, and the Life another: True Love ſets a great price upon its object; and if the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject be, as God is, ſupreme, it rates it above all things; if we ſet the higheſt eſtimate upon God's Will and Glory, nothing can divert us from an holy Life, which complies with his Will, and promotes his Glory; it is irrational to neglect that which we value above all
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:60626:196"/>other things: True Love ſeeks more and more Union with God, to be one Spirit with him; to have <hi>idem velle, &amp; idem nolle;</hi> to love as he loves, that is, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; to hate as he hates, that is Sin. It aſpires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a further transformation into the Divine Image and likeneſs: it never thinks the Soul like enough or near enough to him; where it is thus, there an holy Life cannot be wanting; the Heart being aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated to God, the Life muſt needs anſwer the Heart, and ſhine with the rays of the Divine Image which is there. True Love deſires to have a compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cential reſt and delight in God; it flies to him like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove to the Ark, there to repoſe it ſelf; what weight is in a Body, that Love is in the Soul;<note place="margin">Amor meus Pondus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, <hi>Auſt.</hi>
                  </note> weight makes the Body move towards its center: Love makes the Soul tend, by an holy Life, to center in God the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme goodneſs, leaving all other things as the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria</hi> did her Pitcher. It haſtens in a way of Obedience to enjoy him: Thus we ſee how an holy Life iſſues out of a Regenerate Heart, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly out of Faith and Love; the Doctrine of it is not to be ſlubbered over, as if it did meerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in external Actions or Moralities. But we muſt ſearch and ſee, Whether there be a new Creature, a Work of Regeneration at the bottom of it. <hi>Job,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Friends charged as an hypocrite, tells them, That <hi>the root of the matter was found in him, Job</hi> 19.28. He was not a Man of leaves, and outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances only, but the root of true Piety was in him; without this all good actions, how ſpecious ſoever, are but like the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which, though fair to the Eye, upon a touch fall into aſhes and ſmoak.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, An holy Life proceeds out of a pure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; <hi>Bonum opus Intentio facit, Intentionem Fides

The firſt thing which excordiated Chriſt, and took away his Heart, was the One, the ſingle Eye; and then the Chain of Obedience raviſhed him alſo: without a pure intention a Man, in his faireſt Actions, ſquints and looks awry; by a tacit blaſphemy he makes as if there were ſomething more excellent than the Will and Glory of God for him to look unto; and when Man ſquints, God looks off, and will have none of his Obedience. <hi>Iſrael is an empty Vine, he bringeth forth fruit to himſelf, Hoſ.</hi> 10.1.

To clear this, it is to be conſidered, That the Life muſt be dedicated to God in a double reſpect; it muſt be dedicated to him by a conformity to his Will. And again, It muſt be dedicated to him by a tendency to his Glory. In both theſe there muſt be a pure intention to direct the ſame.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing is, There muſt be a pure Intention in our conformity to the Will of God. <hi>Socinus</hi> ſaith, That there is a <hi>Verbum quoddam interius,</hi> a kind of internal word in Man; that is, a Reaſon to diſcern between that which is juſt, and that which is unjuſt:<note place="margin">Praelect. Theol. c. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> And then he Adds, He that obeys this internal word, obeys God himſelf, <hi>Etiamſi ipſum Deum non eſſe qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dèm aut ſciat aut cogitet;</hi> although he do not know or think that there be a God. And after concludes, That ſuch an Obedience is grateful to God: But as great an Admirer of Holineſs as this Heretick would ſeem to be, it was no leſs than a prophane Aſſertion, to ſay, That there might be a grateful Obedience without any reſpect at all had to God, or his Will. Doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> condemn in the <hi>Athenians</hi> the worſhip of an unknown God? Doth not Chriſt charge the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> that they did worſhip they knew not what? Yet theſe are the <hi>portenta opinionum,</hi> which
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:60626:198"/>this Maſter of Reaſon vents to the World: But to paſs over this; It is not enough for an holy Life, that the thing done be materially good; but it muſt be therefore done, becauſe God commands it ſo to be; an holy Man follows after Holineſs, becauſe this is the Will of God. Now that the material goodneſs of a thing is not enough, may appear by theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. <hi>Jehu</hi> in deſtroying the Houſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> did do that which God commanded him to do; yet God ſaith, That <hi>he will avenge that Blood upon the Houſe of Jehu, Hoſ.</hi> 1.4. And why ſo? <hi>Jehu</hi> did that which God commanded, but he did not obey in it; he did it not in compliance with God's command, but in purſuance of his own deſign; as it is with the hand of a ruſty Dial which ſtands ſtill (ſuppoſe) at ten of the Clock, to a Traveller paſſing at that hour it ſeemeth to go right, but it is but by accident; ſo was it with <hi>Jehu.</hi> He ſeemed to obey in that which hit with his own Will; but he did it not upon the account of God's; for then he would have done other things. But though he deſtroyed <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Houſe, yet he did not deſtroy the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> For there God's Will did not fall in with his. Another Inſtance we have in the acts of Moral Virtue in the Heathen; thoſe acts were materially good, yet they did not in them ſerve God, but their own Reaſon: It's true, right Reaſon ſignifies the very Will of God; but they did them not in compliance with Reaſon, as ſignificative of God's Will; but in compliance with it as a chief part of themſelves. This is evident upon a double account; the one is this, That they were animals of Glory. They did what they did, not in an humble ſubjection to the Will of God, but in a proud ſelf-glorying way; they arrogated all the praiſe and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:60626:198"/>honour to themſelves; in all they did but ſacrifice to the pride of their own Reaſon. The other is this, They did not only follow right Reaſon in their Moral Vertues, but corrupt Reaſon in their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries: The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Their fooliſh Heart was darkned, Rom.</hi> 1.21. Here they followed Reaſon as a part of their corrupt ſelf; which thoſe, who follow it as ſignificative of God's Will, cannot be ſuppoſed to do: Right Reaſon, which imports God's Will, was againſt their Idolatries; yet they continued in them. Hence it appears, that in their Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues they did not ſerve God, but their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Hence St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> contends,<note place="margin">Contr. Jul. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> that their Vertues were not true Vertues. They might be juſt, ſober, merciful; but they did all <hi>infidelitèr,</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Will and Glory of God; <hi>Malè bonum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, qui infidelitèr facit.</hi> Hence, as <hi>Camero</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">Cam. fol. <hi>356.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Lucretia</hi> hated Immodeſty, and <hi>Cato</hi> Perfidiouſneſs; not out of love to God, but becauſe thoſe things were incongruous to Reaſon. Another Inſtance we have in Carnal Profeſſors under the Goſpel; they hear, read, pray, give Alms; but they do not do theſe ſpiritually, in compliance with the Will of God; the Duties are high, but the aims in them are low and carnal: Vaſt is the difference between an Holy and a Carnal Man: An Holy Man is holy even in Natural and Civil Actions; the Kingdom of Heaven is by a pure Intention brought down into his Trade: Nay, into his very Meat and Drink. His deeds are by a Prerogative wrought in God: when he toils as a Servant in ſervile Employment, yet he ſerves the Lord Chriſt; all is ſpiritualized by a pure Intention: But on the other hand, a Carnal Man is carnal even in ſpiritual Actions. There is indeed the <hi>Opus ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum;</hi>
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:60626:199"/>the Fleſh, the outward body of a Duty; but there is no Soul or Spirit in it. No pure Intention to carry it up to the Will and Glory of God, to which it is conſecrated. Thus we ſee, that it is not enough for an holy Life that the thing done be materially good: No; it muſt be done in compliance to the Divine Will: <hi>I will keep the Commandments of my God,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.115. He would keep them, not upon any by-account, but becauſe they were God's, to whoſe Will he dedicated himſelf. <hi>Lo, I come to do thy Will, O God,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.7. And again, <hi>I ſeek not my own Will, but the Will of the Father, which hath ſent me, Joh.</hi> 5.30. Here we have the great Pattern of Holineſs; his Will was devoted and ſwallowed up in God's: all that he did and ſuffered was in conformity to the Divine Will. We muſt not dream of any true Holineſs, till we do what good we do, out of compliance with the Divine Will; as in matters of Faith we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>quià Deus dixit;</hi> ſo in matters of Practice we muſt obey, <hi>quià Deus voluit:</hi> His Command muſt ſway and caſt the Balance in Heart and Life; the Nature of holy Obedience is this, to do what God willeth, <hi>intuitu voluntatis,</hi> becauſe he willeth it: And hence an holy Man doth not pick and chuſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the commands of God, but carry a reſpect to all of them.</p>
               <p>The next thing is this: There muſt be a pure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to direct our good Actions to the Glory of God: ſeing God is <hi>Alpha,</hi> he muſt be <hi>Omega;</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is the Supream good, he muſt be the Ultimate end of all things. Nothing can be more rational than this, That a Creature ſhould be referred to its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; that a finite good ſhould run and do homage
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:60626:199"/>to an Infinite one; nothing can be more abſurd and inordinate than this, That a Creature ſhould be a center to it ſelf, or ſhould be loved or enjoyed for it ſelf; or that God, the moſt excellent Being, ſhould be made but a <hi>Medium,</hi> or ſhould be loved or uſed for ſome other thing. This is practically to blaſpheme, and ſay, God is not God, there is ſomething better than he to be loved and enjoyed for it ſelf. When the Angels would ſtay at home, and <hi>frui ſeipſis,</hi> enjoy themſelves, they became Devils, and loſt all their glory in a moment. All things therefore muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto God; his Glory muſt be the ſupream End; to this Angels fly with Eagles wings; to this holy Men walk; to this irrational Creatures by a ſecret Inſtinct are carried; to this Devils, Will they, nill they, muſt be drawn; this is the great End of all things; for a rational Creature not to aim at this, is againſt Nature and Reaſon; the want of this made an eſſential defect in the Moral Vertues of the <hi>Pagans;</hi> here they fall ſhort; They did not in them aim at the glory of God. This appears in divers things: they at the beſt made Vertue but <hi>pretium ſui,</hi> the Reward of it ſelf for the honeſty which was in it. But they looked no further to the glory of God, as they ought; they looked on themſelves as the chief object of their Love; and ſo this Love never aſcended to God; they boaſted and gloried in their Vertues, as meerly their own, and never ſaw any center but themſelves; they did not therefore aim at the glory of God in them. Hence St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who pronounces them no true Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ſaith, That true Vertues are to be diſcerned,<note place="margin">Contr. Jul. l. <hi>4.</hi>

                  </note> was ſo far convinced of this, that he ſaid, They were <hi>ſteriliter boni,</hi> becauſe they acted not for God: their Vertues would do them no good in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World; in all reaſon, thoſe Vertues which are not referred to God as the ultimate End, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have any thing of Holineſs in them. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be holy without a conſecration to God; and that cannot be without a pure Intention towards his glory. It is not therefore enough for an holy Life to have Moral Vertues, but we muſt ſearch our Hearts, and ſee what our end is; what forms are in Naturals, that the end is in Morals, <hi>As the Man thinketh, ſo is he. Prov.</hi> 23.7. <hi>Mens cujuſque id eſt quiſque,</hi> The Man is as his Mind is, and his Mind is as his End is; though the End be extrinſecal to the Act <hi>in genere entis,</hi> yet it is eſſential to it <hi>in genere moris;</hi> the Act cannot be holy, unleſs the end be ſo: Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, That <hi>whatſoever we do, all muſt be done to the Glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. The <hi>Jewiſh Rabbins</hi> ſay the ſame, That whatever we do, muſt be done <hi>in Nomine Dei,</hi> in the Name of God: an Act not dedicated to that great End, is cut off and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from its center. And upon that account it is not
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:60626:200"/>holy, but common and profane; no leſs a nullity in Spirituals than a Creature, if cut off from God the Fountain of Being, would be in Naturals: Hence St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us, That which is good <hi>in officio,</hi> may yet be ſin <hi>in fine;</hi> For,<note place="margin">Quicquid boni fit, &amp; non propter hoc fit propter quod fieri debet, etſi officio vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur bonum, ipſo non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto fine peccatum eſt, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Jul. l. 4. c. 3.</hi>
                  </note> as the Schools ſpeak, <hi>Finis dat ſpeciem in Moralibus.</hi> Thoſe Acts which are good in the matter of them, may be utterly marred by perverſe Intention: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us than to look to the ſcope of our Actions. Our Saviour Chriſt, the great Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar of Sanctity, tells us, That <hi>he ſought not his own Glory, but his Father's, Joh.</hi> 8.50. compared with <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.18. He was <hi>Deus de Deo,</hi> God of God; the Eternal Greator; yet as he was <hi>in formâ ſervi,</hi> in the form of a Servant, a Man in time, he ſought not his own Glory, but his Father's. We ſee here what is the Deſign of an holy Life; it is that God may be glorified: our Holineſs ſhould ſhine as a little Beam or Spark from the Holy one; the drops and meaſures of Mercy in us ſhould point out that infinite Ocean of Mercy which is in him: We ſhould by our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience tell the World, that God is Supream, and by our ſincerity teſtifie, that he is omniſcient, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent every where; we ſhould ſtudy how to ſerve the Intereſt of the Bleſſed God, how to ſhew forth his Praiſe, how to unfold his Glory in an holy righteous, humble, heavenly Converſation; ſtill there ſhould be <hi>Oculus in metam,</hi> a pure Intention at the Glory of God: If we are by a pure Intention joyned to that great End, then our Works will be ſpiritualized; our Holineſs will never ſee corruption; there will be be a kind of Immortality in every good Action: but if we are off from that great End, our Holineſs periſhes,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:60626:201"/>or rather is none at all. There is a worm at the Root; one baſe, low, inferiour End or other putrifies the good Work, and makes it moulder into nothing. When the Woman in the <hi>Revelations</hi> was ready to be delivered, the Dragon ſtood before her to devour her Child, but it was caught up to God and his Throne. A devout <hi>Papiſt</hi> gloſſes it thus;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>When we bring forth our good Works, Satan ſtands before us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them by one falſe Intention or other, and will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do it, unleſs by a pure one they be caught up to God and his Glory.</hi> Another expoſtulates thus, <hi>Quid juvat bonorum operum prolem gignere, &amp; eam per In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is depravationem necare?</hi> What profits it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a progeny of Good Works, and to kill it by a depraved Intention? A Man, who wants a right Intention, murders his beſt progeny. The Church therefore tells us, That <hi>all her fruits were laid up for Chriſt, Cant.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Propter te, Domine, propter te,</hi> is the holy Man's Motto; all his good Works are by a pure Intention conſecrated unto God: When an Hypocrite doeth good Works, the center and compaſs of all is himſelf only; and upon that account, thoſe Works are not good in the Eyes of God: But when a Saint doeth good Works, they fall into God's Boſom, and center in his Glory. To conclude; Where pure Love adheres to God as the Supream Good, there a pure Intention will dedicate the Life to his Glory, as the ultimate End; then and not before may we call the Life holy.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, An holy Life is humble and dependant upon the influences of God's Spirit and Grace. Hence the Apoſtle bids us, <hi>Work out our Salvation with fear and trembling, Phil.</hi> 2.12. That is, with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: And the Reaſon is added, <hi>For God worketh to
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:60626:201"/>will, and to do of his good pleaſure, verſ.</hi> 13. which would be no Reaſon at all, if we could ſtand upon our own bottom, and work out our Salvation without any dependance upon that Grace, which worketh the Will and the Deed: But if, as the reaſon tells us, God works the Will and the deed of his good pleaſure, then we have all the reaſon in the World to work it out with fear and trembling; as knowing our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God and his Grace. Again; The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the Grace of God, which was with me,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. Obſerve his great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he aſcribes nothing to himſelf, but all to Grace. He ſaid indeed, <hi>I laboured;</hi> yet he piouſlly retracts it, ſaying, <hi>yet not I, but the Grace of God.</hi> He aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes all to Grace, becauſe in all his labours he was in an humble dependance upon it, as being that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he could do nothing. This note of an holy Life doth alſo ſhew, that the Moral Vertues of the Heathens were not right: they were indeed wiſe, ſober, juſt, merciful; but what was their poſture in their doing theſe things? how did they crow, and reflect upon themſelves, and cry up their own Reaſon and Will, as the only Fountains of Vertue? <hi>The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,</hi> ſaith <hi>Epictetus, expects all</hi>

No ſurely; it's horrible Impiety, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Pride, for them thus to lift up themſelves, and dethrone God the great Donor.

A proud Self-ſubſiſter is a Man in a poſture as croſs to the Goſpel as poſſibly can be: the tumor in his Heart makes him uncapable of that Grace which is given to the humble; the Self-ſufficiency there makes it impoſſible for him to live by Faith, as the Juſt do; he depends not on God's Grace, and how can he live to his Glory? he is all to himſelf, and what can God be to him?<note place="margin">Praef. in Pſal. <hi>31.</hi>
                  </note> Some <hi>Pagans,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> would not be Chriſtians, <hi>quià ſufficiunt ſibi de bonâ vitâ ſuâ,</hi> becauſe they could live well of themſelves: If a Man can ſtand upon his own bottom, and work out of his
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:60626:202"/>own ſtock, to what purpoſe are Chriſt and Grace? if he may be a Principle and End to himſelf, what need he go out of his own Circle? Such a Man as this, is an Idol to himſelf, fraught with Vanity and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Preſumption; but utterly void of God and an holy Life. I ſhall ſay no more to this: An holy Life is a Life of dependance; the Juſt or holy Man lives by Faith; he looks to God, and is ſaved; he waits till Mercy come; he commits himſelf to God and his Grace; he leans and rolls upon him, as not bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his own weight; he caſts his burden on him, as being too much for himſelf. He gives himſelf to the Lord, reſigning up all his property in himſelf, that God may be all in all; ſtill he is in dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: He moves but under the Firſt Mover; he acts but under the great Agent; when he ſails to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, he looks for the holy gales; when he ſows precious Seed, he waits for the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dews and Sun-beams: Still he depends upon Grace. In the 119. <hi>Pſal.</hi> where we have the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Vital Religion, <hi>David</hi> admirably ſets forth, how in all his holy actings he did depend upon God: <hi>Thou haſt commanded us to keep thy Precepts; but O that my ways were directed to do ſo, verſ.</hi> 4, <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. <hi>I will keep thy Statutes; but O forſake me not utterly; verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>With my whole Heart have I ſought thee, but O let me not wander from thy Commandments, verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>I will run the way of thy Commandments, but do thou enlarge my Heart, verſ.</hi> 32. <hi>I love thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; but quicken me, O Lord, according to thy loving kindneſs, verſ.</hi> 159. <hi>I have choſen thy Precepts; O let thine Hand help me, verſ.</hi> 173. We ſee here the true Picture of an holy Life: It is working and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it is Obedience and Influence in Conjunction.

                  <hi>Tu dicis te non multa commiſſiſſe: Quare? quo regente?

The holy Man is very ſenſible, that unleſs God bear him up with his Grace, he ſhall ſoon ſink into all manner of fin. Hence that of <hi>Luther, Vita hominis nihil aliud eſt niſi oratio, gemitus, deſiderium, ſuſpirium ad miſericordiam Dei:</hi> Our Life ſhould be a perpetual breathing after that Grace of God, upon which we depend: Were we full of divine Light, yet if we ſhould ſhut the windows, and go about to poſſeſs it in a Self-ſubſiſtence, we ſhould ſoon be in the dark,

The holy Man is a Part or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt, and lives in dependance upon him as the Head. There is, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Spirit deſcending from Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, which touches all his Members, and makes a kind of Spiritual continuity between him and them: Hence they are ſaid in Scripture to live in the Spirit, pray in the Spirit, walk in the Spirit, do all in the Influence of that Spirit, which comes down from the Head to actuate their Graces: Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, Gal.</hi> 2.20. His Graces as they had their Being from Chriſt the true <hi>Immanuel,</hi> ſo were they continued and actuated by the Influences of his Spirit; which in a ſober ſence are a kind of <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God with us, to uphold and quicken us to all holy Obedience. As the humane Nature of Chriſt acted not in a ſeparate way, but in union with the Divine; ſo the Believers Graces do nothing apart, but all in union with Chriſt. Still there muſt be, as the <hi>Milevitan</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel tells us, an <hi>Adjutorium Gratiae,</hi> a ſupernatural Aid to work in us to will and to do.

He is therefore depending upon that Spirit which acts the Sons of God in pure ways towards Heaven: To deny this dependance, is, like the worſhippers of Angels, <hi>Not to hold the Head, from which all the Body by
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:60626:204"/>joynts and bands, having nouriſhment miniſtred, and knit together, increaſeth with the increaſe of God, Col.</hi> 2.19. Were the holy Man off from the Head, what would become of him? what illapſes of the Spirit or Influences of Grace could he look for in a ſtate ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from him? how could he remain holy, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Divine Life any longer? In ſuch a caſe he would be no longer a living Branch, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>quaſi</hi> Branch, dead and withered, and fit for the Fire, as the Expoſition is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.6. He could no more walk in Holineſs, than the old <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> (as the Fable runs) could walk a great way with his Head off. We ſee then what manner of thing a true holy Life is; it is that which ſtands in doing the Will of God in a way of humble dependance upon his Grace; it is not enough to do that which is good, but we muſt do it waiting, and looking up to the God of Grace, that he would ſtrengthen our inner Man, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſteps, hold up our goings in his paths, encline our Hearts, and work all our works in us; that he would by the continual ſupplies of his Spirit enlighten us when dark, quicken us when dead, draw us when backward, hold us when falling, enlarge us when in ſtraits, and actuate our Graces in the midſt of our infirmities: How excellent is the Life, when God's Arm joyns it ſelf to ours to ſet it a working; when the Spirit breaths on our Graces, and the Spices flow out; when the Influences of Auxiliary Grace are as Dew; and the Roots of Habitual Graces caſt forth themſelves in holy works ſutable thereunto; when there is Grace with our Spirit: and, in a ſence, a kind of <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God with us, to incline our Hearts to do all the Will of God; and in the power of his Grace we ſet our ſelves ſeriouſly to the doing of it?
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:60626:204"/>This is indeed an holy Life; not only good in the matter, but pious in the manner of it; a vein of Faith and dependance runs through every Good Work: God, the Fountain and Original of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is ſanctified in every ſtep we take: there is an holy Life in us; but the Fountain of Life is above; we do Good Works, but God is the Great Operator, he works all our Works in us. I ſhall conclude with that of the <hi>Arauſican</hi> Councel, <hi>Adjutorium Dei etiàm renatis ac ſanctis ſemper eſt implorandum, ut ad finem bonum pervenire, vel in bono opere perdurare poſſint, Can.</hi> 10. Help from the Holy One muſt be ever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored, even by the Saints themſelves, that they may arrive at the good End, and abide in the Good Work.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In an holy Life there muſt be a ſincere mortification of ſin, without any <hi>ſalvo</hi> or exception; no known ſin may be indulged or ſpared: It's true, in an holy Man there are reliques of in-dwelling ſin adhering to him; there are quotidian Infirmities, Effluvium's of Humane Frailty, breathing forth from him; but neither of theſe are indulged; both are inevitable in this Life: Original Corruption is a very great burden to him; it is the grief of his Heart, to have ſuch an evil in his Boſom; to be a clog upon his Faculties, a damp upon his Prayers, a cooler up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Zeal and Charity, and a ſtain upon all his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Good Works. This makes him groan, and cry out, <hi>Oh! wretched Man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from this Body of Death?</hi> This is an Evil always preſent; the holy Man ſhakes himſelf, and yet it adheres; he flies, and yet it encompaſſes; he mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies, and yet he muſt mortify on; it is not, it will not be extinct till Death diſſolves him into duſt: He
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:60626:205"/>prays, weeps, ſweats, fights, runs, labours, and yet he cannot make a total riddance of it. However, he indulges it not; in like manner is it with his daily Infirmities; theſe are not indulged, but they lie as an heavy burden upon him: he wiſhes for, he breaths after Perfection: Oh! that there were no remaining Sin, no moats of Infirmity: But alas! it will not be here;<note place="margin">Auſt. de Temp. Serm. <hi>45.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Concupiſcere nolo; &amp; concupiſco,</hi> ſaith the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Innate corruption will be ſtirring and bubling up in us; all that can be done on Earth; is to war and fight againſt it; the Triumph, the Crown of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Perfection can be found no where but in Heaven: But to clear this Particular, I ſhall ſet down two things.</p>
               <p>The one is this: A Man, who indulges or allows ſin in himſelf, cannot, while he doth ſo, lead an holy Life: he hath no Principles for it; no Principle of Repentance; he cannot mourn over ſin, while he joys in it; he cannot hate ſin, while he loves it; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forſake ſin, while he follows after it. No Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Faith; he cannot truſt in God's Mercy, when he rebels, and is in Arms againſt him; he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lord Chriſt, when he hath another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to rule over him; he cannot cloſe in with the precious Promiſes of the Goſpel, when he embraces the lying Promiſes of Sin. No Principle of Holy Love; he cannot truly love God, with an Idol in his Heart; he cannot love him, and cloſe in with ſin his great Enemy; he cannot love him, and habitually, willingly violate his Commands: Such an one can have no pure Intention towards God's Will or Glory: not towards God's Will; he obeys with a <hi>ſalvo</hi> or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; he picks and chuſes among the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; he complies only with thoſe Commands
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:60626:205"/>which croſs not his darling Luſt. The <hi>Jewiſh Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi> ſay; He that ſaith, I receive the whole Law, except one word only, deſpiſes the Command of God. The ſame Divine Authority is upon all the Commands; and that Obedience, which is with the exception of one Command which croſſes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Luſt, is as none at all: Nor yet towards God's Glory: How can he glorify God, who by willful ſinning diſhonours him? or how can he aim at that Glory, who aims at the ſatisfaction of his own Luſt? or which way can one promote two ſuch contrary ends, as that Glory, and his own Satisfaction? Heaven and Hell, Light and Darkneſs, Holineſs and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may as ſoon be reconciled, as two ſuch contrary ends can meet together. Every indulged Luſt is one Idol or other; either it is <hi>Baal,</hi> Pride and Lorlineſs, or <hi>Aſhtaroth,</hi> Wealth and Riches, or <hi>Venus,</hi> carnal and ſenſual pleaſure, or <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> Force and earthly Power; unleſs the Idol be put away, we cannot ſerve God in in an holy Life.</p>
               <p>The other thing is this: It is of high concern to an holy Life to mortify Sin. An holy Man is one in Covenant with God; therefore he muſt maintain war againſt Sin, the Enemy of God; Sin is an oppoſite to God, a rebellion againſt his Sovereignty, a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to his Holineſs, an abuſe to his Grace, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to his Juſtice, a diſparagement to his Glory; and how can an holy Man, a Friend of God do leſs than ſet himſelf againſt it, that he may kill and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it? <hi>Ye that love the Lord, hate evil,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 97.10. The Exhortation is pregnant with excellent Reaſon: If you do indeed love God, who is Purity, Power, Wiſdom, Excellency it ſelf; ye can do no leſs than hate Sin, which is Pollution,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:60626:206"/>Weakneſs, Folly, and Vileneſs; and if you do hate it, you will ſeek the utter ruine and extirpation of it: an holy Man is one in union with Chriſt, and upon that account he muſt mortify Sin: in Chriſt crucified he hath a pattern of Mortification; what was done to his pure Fleſh in a way of Expiation, muſt be done to our corrupt Fleſh in a way of Mortification. The Nails which faſtned him to the Croſs, tell us, that our corruption muſt have ſuch a reſtraint upon it, that it may, like one on a Croſs, be diſabled to go forth into thoſe acts of ſin which it is propenſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; the piercing and letting out his Heart-blood, ſhews us that the Old Man muſt not only be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but pierced; that the vital Blood, the internal love of ſin may be let out of the Heart; he was active in his Paſſion; he freely laid down his Life, yet violence was done to him; in like manner we muſt freely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice our Luſts; we muſt willingly die to ſin, yet ſin muſt not die a Natural Death, but a violent one; it muſt be ſtabb'd at the heart, and die of its wounds: And, becauſe it will not die all at once, it muſt by little and little languiſh away till it give up the Ghoſt; there muſt be Mortification upon Mortification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſin is long a dying. But further we have from Chriſt not an Examplar of mortification only, but a Spirit and Divine Power for the Work, while by Faith we converſe about the wounds of Chriſt; We have that Spirit from him, which mortifies the deeds of the Body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. That mind of Chriſt which makes us ſuffer in the Fleſh, ceaſing from ſin, <hi>That we may no longer live to the Luſts of Men, but to the Will of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1, <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. If then the holy Man will live like himſelf, and as becomes a Member of Chriſt, he muſt by that Vertue and Spirit, which he
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:60626:206"/>hath from him, crucify his Luſts and Corruptions: Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>They that are Chriſt's, have cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts, Gal.</hi> 5.24. They ought to crucify them; they do crucify them ſo far, that ſin can reign no longer; they go on crucifying every day more and more, that the body of ſin may be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Moreover, An holy Man hath ſuch a Divine Faith, as blaſts all the World in compariſon of Heavenly things; in the Eyes of Faith, Earthly Riches are not the true ones: thoſe Treaſures which glitter ſo much to Senſe, are but poor moth-eaten things; the World's ſubſtance is but a ſhadow, an apparition, a thing that is not; too low for an immortal Soul to aim at; too mean to enrich the inward Man; the ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which raviſh Fleſh and Blood, are but the vain titillations of the outward Man; Momentary things; ſuch as periſh in the uſing, and die in the embraces, leaving nothing behind them but a ſting and worm in the Conſcience of the poor voluptuary. Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane Glories, which take carnal Men ſo much, appear to be but a blaſt; a little popular Air: to a Man up among the Stars, the whole Earth would be but a ſmall thing; and to a Man who by Faith converſes in Heaven, Earthly Crowns and Scepters are no better. Now when Sin, which uſes to wrap up it ſelf in one piece of the World or other, is blaſted in its Covers and Dreſſes of apparent Good; when thoſe Pomps and Fancies of the World, which uſually paint and cover Sin, to render it eligible unto Men, are diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Faith to be but vanities and empty Nothings, Sin will be loved no longer: nay, it will look accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its own hue like a vile, baſe, deformed thing, fit for nothing but to be hung upon a Croſs; there to
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:60626:207"/>die and expire. Hence it appears, that an holy Man as long as his Faith diſcovers a vanity and nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the faireſt proſpects of the World, muſt needs overcome the World, and the luſts of it. Again, An holy Man, according to that ſupernatural Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is upon him, ſurrenders up his Love, and Joy, and Delight to God and Chriſt and Heavenly things; the ſtream of his Heart, which before run out upon the lying vanities here below, is now turned to the excellent things above; his Converſation is in Heaven; his Treaſure and his Heart are both there; and then what muſt become of Sin? muſt it not needs die away, and become as a Body without a Spirit in it? It is the Love, and the Joy, and the Delight of Man which animate Sin; but if theſe are not here any longer, but riſen and gone away into the upper World, to place and center themſelves upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent objects which are there, then Sin muſt needs languiſh and die away; it hath nothing to animate or enliven it any more: were this Divine ſurrender in perfection, Sin could not ſo much as be; and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably where it is but in truth only, Sin muſt needs grow heartleſs and powerleſs. Notable is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Walk in the Spirit, i.e.</hi> in the Elevations of holy Faith and Love, <hi>and ye ſhall not fulfill the luſts of Fleſh, Gal.</hi> 5.16. Sin ſhall grow weak, and by little and little give up the Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Character; An holy Man, which way ſoever he looks, ſees juſt reaſon to mortify Sin; the rectitude of the Law ſaith, It muſt die for its crookedneſs and ataxy: the threatning of Death ſaith, It muſt die, or the Soul muſt die in the room of it. The bleeding Wounds of our dying Lord ſay, That the Crucifier muſt not be ſpared, but die after that manner.
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:60626:207"/>That excellent Gueſt, the holy Spirit, ſaith, It is too vile a thing to live under the ſame roof with it ſelf. The precious immortal Soul ſaith, The wounds and turpitudes of it are too intolerable to be endured any longer. Heaven, that bleſſed Region, ſaith, It is not to be tolerated by any who mean to enter into that place: We muſt then <hi>mortifie the deeds of the Body, that we may live, Rom.</hi> 8.13. that we may live a Life of Holineſs here, and a Life of Glory in another World.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, An holy Life is not made up of the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this or that Grace in particular; but of the Exerciſe of all Graces, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> as occaſion ſerves. St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>That we muſt add to our Faith Vertue, to Vertue Knowledge, to Knowledge Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to Temperance Patience, to Patience Godlineſs, to Godlineſs Brotherly kindneſs, and to Brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Charity,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. Holy Men, who are partakers of the Divine Nature, ſpoken of immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before, have Grace upon Grace; and muſt, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſerves, exerciſe one after another, that there may be a Conſtellation of Graces appearing in their Lives, to give the more full reſemblance of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which are in their Father in Heaven; our Saviour Chriſt (in whom all Graces are ſet forth in lively and Orient colours, and are really and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally exemplified to our view) had this character juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given him, <hi>he went up and down down doing good;</hi> every ſtep one odour of Grace or other brake forth from him: Subjection to Parents or Magiſtrates, or Zeal towards God, or Humility in waſhing his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples feet, or Meekneſs under falſe Accuſations, or melting Compaſſions letting out cures on the Bodies and Heavenly truths on the Souls of Men, or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:60626:208"/>Patience under great ſorrows and ſufferings; one glorious way of Holineſs or other was always coming from him: Proportionably, an holy Man, Who is a living Member of Chriſt, muſt be in his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>holy in all manner of Converſation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. In the Original it is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he turn himſelf, he muſt be holy in it: he muſt have a reſpect to God at every turn; this will beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the particular parts of his Life.</p>
               <p>Take an holy Man in Divine Ordinances, there he is holy: He would firſt be ſure that he is in a right Church, and in a right Ordinance; in a right Church; for there the Lord commands the Bleſſing, even Life for evermore; in a right Ordinance, for unleſs the Inſtitution be from God, the Benediction cannot be expected from him: and then he would ſerve God in a right manner, and ſanctify his Name in his approaches; when he comes to an Ordinance, he hath high thoughts of God, as being the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Majeſty of Heaven, the Excellency of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; one whom Angels adore, and Devils tremble at: accordingly he lies low before God; he ſerves him with Reverence and godly Fear; he draws nigh to him, yet forgets not the infinite diſtance between them; he bluſhes to think that he muſt go before ſo pure a Majeſty, with the duſt of Mortality about him: and again he bluſhes to think, that he muſt do ſo in the ſpots and rags of many Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which being in the Soul are much more aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than thoſe in the Body. The Beams of the Divine Glory ſtrike an holy awe into him, and make him conclude, That a Soul, though entirely given up, is to God but a little, very little thing; but as a Beam to the Sun, or a drop to the Ocean; and,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:60626:208"/>which is matter of more ſhame and abaſement; the Soul is much leſs, in that the innate corruption holds back, and the bewitching World ſteals away a great deal of it from God: very little or rather nothing it is, that we can give to him; however the holy Man, ſuch is his Divine temper, would not abate any thing, but endeavour in Ordinances to give God his Spirit and higheſt Intention; he knows that God is a Spirit, and meer bodily worſhip is as nothing to him: what is the bowing of the Knee, when there is an Iron Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new of Rebellion within? or the lifting up of the Hands or Eyes, when there is an earthly depreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the affections? towhat purpoſe is an open Ear, when the Heart is deaf and ſhut up againſt holy Truths? And what a ſhadow, a meer lye in worſhip is the Body, when the Mind is ſtole away and gone after Vanity? He therefore ſets himſelf to ſerve God in ſpirit and truth; while God is ſpeaking to him in his Sacred Word, he would have no converſe at all with worldly objects; he bids theſe ſtand by, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt his attention, while he is ſpeaking to God in prayer; he would not only pour out words to God, but his very Heart and Spirit, if it were poſſible, all of it, without reſerving ſo much as a glance or a piece of a broken thought towards carnal things; a Duty to the Great God is a thing of vaſt import and conſequence; therefore he would do it with the greateſt ſtrength of intention and affection. <hi>David</hi> like he calls upon his Soul, and all that is within him to intend the thing in hand; but becauſe when he hath done his utmoſt, there will yet be many failures and infirmities; the holy Man looks up to Mercy for a Pardon, and offers up all his Duties in and through Jeſus Chriſt the great Mediator. In the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:60626:209"/>the holy Man prayed thus, <hi>Remember, O my God, and ſpare me, Neh.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Enter not into judgment with thy Servant, Pſal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldeſt mark iniquities, who ſhall ſtand? Pſal.</hi> 130.3. The ſenſe of their many imperfections made them fly to a Mercy-ſeat: In the New Teſtament we are expreſly directed, <hi>To do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, Col.</hi> 3.17. <hi>To make our approaches to God in and through him, Eph.</hi> 2.18. <hi>To offer up ſpiritual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices acceptable to God by him,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. Every Duty muſt be tendred unto God in and through the Mediator: therefore the holy Man doth not ſtand upon the Perfection of his Services, but implore a Pardon of his Infirmities; neither doth he tender his Services immediately unto God, but he puts them into the hand of Chriſt, that being perfumed, and as it were, glorified by his merits, they might from thence aſcend up before God, and be graciouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by him. Moreover, becauſe Ordinances are but Medium's and Chanels of Grace, the Holy Man in the uſe of them lifts up his Eyes to God, to have them filled with the Divine Spirit and Bleſſing; a meer outward Sanctuary of Ordinances will not ſerve his turn; he would ſee the Power and the Glory, the goings of God in it: He cannot live by Bread only; not the Life of Nature by the Bread of Creatures only; not the Life of Grace by the Bread of Ordinances only: in both he waits for that word of Bleſſing, which proceeds out of God's Mouth; this is that which makes the Ordinance communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Grace and Comfort to us: When the Word is preached, it is not enough to the holy Man to have the Sacred Truths outwardly propoſed, or to hear the voice of a Man teaching the ſame; but his Heart
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:60626:209"/>and his Fleſh cry out for the Living God. Oh! that God would ſpeak inwardly in words of Life and Power! that deep and Divine impreſſions might be made upon the Heart, to ſanctify it by the Truth, and to caſt it more and more into the mould of the Divine Will! Oh! that God would come and ſhine into the Heart, that he would uncover the holy things, and bring forth Evangelical Myſteries to the view, that the Heart might be raviſhed in the ſweet odours of Chriſt; that the Promiſes might flow out as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit of Celeſtial Wine, and make the Soul taſte ſome drops of the pure Rivers of pleaſure which are above! This is the deſire and expectation of the holy Man in hearing; in like manner in Prayer it is not enough to him to pour out words before God, but he looks for the holy Spirit, to help his Infirmities, and breath upon his Devotions; that as Chriſt pleads above by his Merits and Sweet-ſmelling Sacrifice, ſo the Holy Spirit may plead in the Heart with ſighs and groans that cannot be uttered; being conſcious to himſelf, what a thing his Heart is; how much coldneſs, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſtraitneſs is yet remaining there; he waits for the Spirit to be as fire from Heaven to inflame the Heart, and make it aſcend up unto God; to melt it, and make it open and expand towards Heaven, to ſet it a running in Spiritual fluency and enlargements to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. The holy Man eſteems all to be loſt and to no purpoſe, unleſs he can have ſome converſe and communion with God in every ordinance: his Heart and the Ordinance have both the ſame ſcope and tendency, that there may be a Divine inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between God and him; <hi>God draws, and he runs, Cant.</hi> 1.4. God ſaith, <hi>Seek ye my Face;</hi> And the Soul anſwers, <hi>Thy Face, Lord, will I ſeek, Pſal.</hi> 27.8.
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:60626:210"/>There are Divine Influences and Spirations on God's part, and there are compliances and reſponſes in the holy Heart; in Prayer it burns and aſpires after him who ſet it a fire by the communications of his Grace and Love; in Praiſe it carries back the received Bleſſings, and lays them down at the feet of the great Donor; in the hearing of the Word, it hath ſomething or other to anſwer to every part; it trembles at the threatning; it leaps up, and in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of Faith embraces the Promiſe; it complies with the pure Command in holy Love and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: without this Communion, in which God and Man ſpiritually meet together, the holy Man looks on Ordinances, but as dry empty things, void of Life; and ſeparate from their chief end; but if the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit breath upon the Heart, and that breath out it ſelf to God; if the Soul ſet it ſelf to ſeek God's Face, and that irradiate the Duty; then the Ordinance is full of Life, and reaches its end. The holy Man then perceives that God is in it of a truth: hence one, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> relates, uſed to riſe from Duty with theſe words, <hi>Claudimini oculi mei, claudimini, nihil enim pulchrius jàm videbitis;</hi> Be ſhut, O my Eyes, be ſhut, for I ſhall never behold a fairer object than God's Face, which I have now beheld.</p>
               <p>Take him in Alms and Charity, he is holy there; he knows that he was born, nay, and by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Generation born again, that he might do good: It was a notable Speech of the Philoſoper, The Beaſts, Plants, Sun, Stars were deſigned for ſome work or other, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and what are you for? When he thinks that he is a Man, a rational Creature, and, which is more, a new Creature, and by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option one of the Seed Royal of Heaven; he ſees a
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:60626:210"/>neceſſity laid upon him to be fruitful in Charity and Good Works: If he who hath a firſt and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Birth, who hath the good things of Nature and Grace, do not do good, who ſhall do it? or where may it be expected? The holy Man therefore ſets himſelf to do good; he doth not only do the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work of Charity, but he doth it readily and freely; when an object of Charity meets him, he doth not ſay, Go and come again, when he himſelf goes to the Mercy-ſeat, he would not have God delay or turn him off after that manner: Neither will he do ſo to his poor Brother, not only the command of God, but the taſte; that he hath, of the Divine Grace, make him ready and free in good Works; his Good Works have not only a Body, but there is a free Spirit in them; and as the thing given ſupplies the Receiver's want, ſo the manner of giving revives his Spirit: The holy Man doth not only give Alms, but he doth it out of Love and Compaſſion; <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficentiâ ex Benevolentiâ manare debet;</hi> he doth good out of good will; he opens his heart as well as his hand; he doth not only draw out his Alms, but his Soul to the hungry; he doth not only give outward things, but himſelf in real compaſſions to the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: he knows that Sacrifice is not acceptable to God without Mercy; no more is the outward Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without inward Pity; he therefore as the Elect of God, puts on Bowels of Mercy, that when his hand is diſtributing, his Bowels may be moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe in miſery; that he may not give a meer external thing, but <hi>aliquid ſui ipſius,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himſelf; I mean, his Compaſſion;<note place="margin">Si nihil habes, da lacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulam; magnum enim ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latium afflicto eſt miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia, <hi>Naz.

                  </note> it doubles the Alms to give it with Pity; meer Mercy in it ſelf is a comfort to the afflicted, but when it comes with a ſupply
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:60626:211"/>of neceſſaries in its hand; it is then a comfort in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and manner. Moreover, the holy Man hath not only humane Bowels, but Chriſtian; in all his acts of Charity he moves from an high Principle, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an high end: and upon that account the Apoſtle calls thoſe acts <hi>Pure Religion, Jam.</hi> 1.27. And St.<note place="margin">Ipſa miſericordia, ſi pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter Deum non fit, non eſt Sacrificium: Sacrificium res divina eſt. <hi>Auſt. de Civ. Dei l. 10. c. 6.</hi>

                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> call them a Sacrifice, a Divine thing. Firſt, I ſay, He acts from an high Principle; he doth not extend Mercy to Men in miſery, only out of humanity, but out of love to God; he doth not reſpect them, meerly becauſe they are his own Fleſh, ſuch as are in conjunction of Nature with him; but chiefly becauſe they are rational Creatures, ſuch as ſtand in Relation to God, and are capable of union with him; the love of God, (who alone is to be loved for himſelf) is the great Wheel which moves our Love and Mercy towards our Neighbour. St. <hi>John</hi> argues thus, <hi>Whoſo ſeeth his Brother have need, and ſhutteth up his Bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the Love of God in him?</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 17. It is all one, as if he had ſaid, There is no Love of God at all in him; for if there were any that would open his Bowels towards his Brother, Piety towards God is the right Fountain of Charity towards Men. Again,<note place="margin">De Doctr. Chriſt. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> He acts unto an high end; <hi>Charitas eſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus animi ad fruendum Deo propter ipſum, &amp; ſe &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximo propter Deum,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Charity is the motion of the Soul to enjoy God for himſelf, and it ſelf and its Neighbour for God. The holy Man in his acts of Charity hath a Supream reſpect unto God; he would reſemble and glorify God in them; there is nothing wherein he can ſhew himſelf more like unto God than in Mercy and Love: God, when he
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:60626:211"/>proclaims his Name, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. inſiſts very much upon Mercy. <hi>He is good, and doth good, Pſal.</hi> 119.68. Therefore the holy Man would be ſtill a doing of good, that he might in his Sphear, though but a little one, reſemble that God; who doth good in the great Sphear of Nature; God makes his Sun to ſhine and rain to fall every where: and the holy Man, who would be like him, endeavours to ſhine in good works, and drop in Charities upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; in all he would have no other center than God and his Glory; his aim is, that thoſe drops and models of Mercy which are in him may bear witneſs to the infinite Fountain and Ocean of Mercy which is above; ſtill he deſires that God in all things may be glorified.</p>
               <p>Take him in proſperity, he is holy there. I may ſay of him what the Hiſtorian ſaith of <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour, His Proſperity doth not make him leave his Piety. He eſteems himſelf leſs than the leaſt of God's Mercies; he holds all that he hath <hi>in capite</hi> of God the great Donor; he deſires to ſee free Grace in every crum of Bread, drop of drink, and moments pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; when there is a Table ſpread, and a Cup running over, and an affluence of all good things; he ſuffers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be loſt; but returns all in a thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment unto the giver: Thus holy <hi>David, All things are of thee,</hi> 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 29.14. Life, Health, Peace, Proſperity, the whole Catalogue of Bleſſings are from God; the holy Man looks on it as no leſs than Sacriledge to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract the leaſt fragment from him. He looks upon Bleſſings in dependance upon their Original; he ſees the ſence and meaning of them to be this, that our hearts may be guided and directed by them to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Fountain of Goodneſs. He poſſeſſes them, but he
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:60626:212"/>will not be poſſeſſed by them; they may flow round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, but they muſt keep their diſtance, and not enter into the heart, which is reſerved as an holy place for God; while they ſtand without and miniſter to the outward Man, they are Bleſſings, and Glaſſes of the Divine Goodneſs; but if once they lean their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are taken into the Heart, they are Idols and Vanities; there is a blaſt and a curſe upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they turn away the Heart from God the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Living Waters: In the midſt of all outward Bleſſings, the holy Man is but a Pilgrim in this World; here is not his Happineſs his happineſs or center of reſt; he looks after far greater and nobler things tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> thoſe which grow here below; Corn, and Wine, and Oil are in his Eyes but poor things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of God's favour: Heaven is his Country, and by a Divine touch, from thence, his Heart, though courted by the World, will point thither; he reſolves with himſelf, he will be happy only in God, and in nothing elſe: whilſt he is here, he uſes his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good things in the fear of God. He knows that <hi>The Earth is the Lord's, and the fulneſs thereof:</hi> God is the abſolute Proprietor, and Man but a Steward only. The poor Man in his neceſſities hath a right to have ſupply out of the ſuperfluities of the Rich; the Charity of the Rich is but <hi>Fidelitas in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieno,</hi> Faithfulneſs in that which is another Man's, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.12. Riches are a Talent and muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for; if oppreſſion make the beam cry out of the wall, or if outward things become the fuel of of luſt, or if the non-uſer bring a ruſt upon them, it will be a very ill reckoning at the laſt day; therefore the holy Man endeavours to perform his truſt; he is, what his Riches call for, rich in good Works; the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:60626:212"/>Goodneſs of God to him makes him good to others; the open hand of the great Donor makes him aſhamed to ſhut his own: his great intereſt lies in the other World; and upon that account the exchanges his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards things thither, by ſuch acts of Charity as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and live for ever.</p>
               <p>Take him in adverſity, he is holy there; as in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity his anſwer is (what was ſo much in the mouth of the ancient Chriſtians) <hi>Deo gratias,</hi>

When he is toſſed on Earth, he caſts his Anchor in Heaven; his Heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord; in an admirable manner he hangs upon him who ſmites him; he adheres to him who ſeems to caſt him off; he looks for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſupport from him, who preſſes him down; he expects that the very hand which wounded, ſhould heal him; though all outward things take wing, and fly away; he will not part with God; though God wrap up himſelf in a cloud of black Providences, yet he will wait at the door of one Promiſe or other, till he have a ſmile or glimpſe of the Divine favour; and, if that be ſuſpended, yet he will wait on, and comfort himſelf, the affliction is not Hell; all the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:60626:213"/>troubles of this Life are but the aſhes of the furnace, a little time will blow them away; and then comes an Heaven, an Eternity of joy and comfort which pays for all: The holy Man will wait, but that is not all, he ſets himſelf ſeriouſly to read the meaning of the Croſs; and by comparing his Heart and this affliction, he picks out the ſence thus, Here, ſaith he, pointing to his Heart, is the vanity, and there's the Fan which drives away the Chaff; here's the droſs of earthly affections, and there's the Fire which melts it away; here are the ill humours, and there the bitters Pills which purge them out; and while he is humbling himſelf in ſuch conſiderations as theſe, at laſt he comes to read Love in the Croſs; and to have a ſweet experience, that even that works for his good; God doth it in faithfulneſs to wean him from the Breaſts of Creatures; and to endear Heaven to him; to make him learn that great Leſſon, To be ſubject to the Father of Spirits, and live for ever; to make his Faith and Patience come forth as gold doth out of the Furnace, in their pure luſtre and glory: and, as ſoon as he perceives this, all is well; he can now ſit down, and ſing <hi>Deo gratias;</hi> not to Bleſſings only, but alſo to Afflictions; upon the whole account he finds, That it was good for him that he was afflicted. Thus he ſanctifies God under the Croſs.</p>
               <p>Take him in his Contracts and Dealings in the World, he is holy there; he doth, according to that golden Rule, Do to others as he would have them do to him. In his Contracts he deals <hi>Bonâ fide,</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and honeſtly: ſo he makes, and ſo he performs them. In Selling, he will have no more gain than what is reaſonable, and in a juſt proportion: In Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he will allow as much; he impoſes not upon an
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:60626:213"/>unskillful Perſon, but uſes him as one would a Child, in a fair manner; he will not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, go beyond his Brother; he will not have <hi>Lucrum in Arcâ, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num in Conſcientiâ,</hi> gain in the Purſe, with loſs in the Conſcience. No; he loves plainneſs, he ſpeaks the truth, he doth that which is juſt and right; he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries himſelf like a true honeſt Man; and this he doth with a reſpect to God. Three great things God calls for in the Prophet, <hi>To do juſtly, and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with God, Micah</hi> 6.8. If there be no Righteouſneſs, there will be no Mercy; if there be no Mercy, there will be no humble Walking with God. Three great things the Goſpel Grace calls for in the Apoſtle, <hi>To live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in the World, Tit.</hi> 2.12. Here is <hi>Summa Vitae Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianae,</hi> the total of Chriſtianity, to live ſoberly, as to our ſelves; righteouſly as to others; and godly as to God. Still Righteouſneſs is one of the three; the holy Man deals juſtly, not meerly becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to his own Reaſon, but becauſe it is congruous to the will of God: the fear of God urges him to it; If he did oppreſs, <hi>Deſtruction from God would be a terror to him, Job</hi> 31.23. A Divine <hi>Nemeſis</hi> would purſue and overtake him: the love of God conſtrains him to it; God is true to him, and he will not be falſe to others. God is mercifull to him, and he will not be unjuſt to others. The honour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion calls for it from him; He that is pious in the firſt Table, muſt not be wicked in the ſecond: A Chriſtian muſt not in Honeſty be below a Pagan; the Child of Grace muſt not live againſt Principles of Nature; Grace is not to take away Morality, but to refine and ſpiritualize it. An horrible ſhame and blot it would be upon Chriſtianity, if Pagans ſhould
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:60626:214"/>live as Men in juſt and fair dealing among themſelves; and yet Chriſtians ſhould live as Wolves or Beaſts of prey, tearing and devouring one another. <hi>In nobis Chriſtus patitur opprobrium,</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, Take him in a Calling, he is holy there; he knows he muſt not be idle. That of <hi>Cato</hi> hath been received as an Oracle, <hi>Nihil agendo, malè agere diſcis;</hi> Idleneſs teaches to do evil; it opens an ear to every extravagant motion; it entertains every ſinful fancy; it tempts the Devil, the great Tempter, to tempt us. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> adviſeth his Friends thus, <hi>Semper aliquid boni operis facito, ut Diabolus te ſemper inveniat occupatum,</hi> Be always a doing of ſome good thing, that the Devil may not find thee at leiſure: the Holy Man therefore will have a Calling, and <hi>therein he will abide with God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.24. and his Works, by a Divine Prerogative, <hi>are wrought in God, Joh.</hi> 3.21.

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:60626:214"/>Col.</hi> 3.23. The great end and center of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is God's Glory, and under that he deſigns to do good to Men; he would <hi>conferre aliquid in publicum,</hi> caſts in ſomething into the common good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: An Holy Magiſtrate hath the fear of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; he judges not for Man, but for the Lord; he judges righteous Judgment; and that, as the <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſay, is a ſure ſign that the <hi>Shecinah,</hi> the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is with him in the judgment: An Holy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter carries with him an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> Light in his Doctrine, and Integrity in his Life. He burns in zeal for God and Chriſt; he melts in labours and compaſſions for the Souls of Men. His <hi>Motto</hi> is the ſame with that of Mr. <hi>Perkins, Verbi Miniſter es, hoc age.</hi> In a word, whatever the Calling be, the Holy Man is active, faithful, bent for the Glory of God; ſtill he remembers that he is a Chriſtian; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath an influence upon his Calling. His par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Calling, which is <hi>Vocatio ad munus,</hi> to a courſe of Life, is made ſubordinate to his general Calling, which is <hi>Vocatio ad Faedus,</hi> to the Faith and Obedience of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee, An Holy Man is like himſelf at every turn, as occaſion is; one odour of Grace or other is ſtill a breaking forth from him.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In an Holy Life there is not only an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Graces, but in that Exerciſe a growth of them; the Holy Man of a Plant comes to be a Tree of Righteouſneſs; of a Babe he comes to be a Man in Chriſt; he goes from ſtrength to ſtrength; his path is as the ſhining Light, <hi>which ſhines more and more unto the perfect day, Prov.</hi> 4.18. He travels on from Vertue to Vertue, to meet the everlaſting day: He grows in every part of the New Creature, till he
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:60626:215"/>come to Heaven, where Grace is perfected in Glory. His Knowledg grows; by following on to know the Lord, he comes to know more of him; by doing of God's Will, he comes to underſtand it better than ever he did; the Eye is more open, the Heart is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, the Truth is more ſealed to the Mind, the Underſtanding is more quick in the Fear of the Lord, the Taſte and Savour of Divine things is higher than it was before: he had at his firſt Converſion a ſpiritual Knowledg and Underſtanding, but exerciſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Godlineſs, he comes by degrees <hi>to all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. and <hi>to Riches of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Col.</hi> 2.2. Notions are enlarged, and withal Heavenly things are known <hi>per guſtum ſpiritualem,</hi> by a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual taſte of them: his Faith grows; at firſt there was but <hi>contactus;</hi> but upon the Exerciſe of Graces there comes to be <hi>complexus fidei;</hi> the touch of Chriſt by Faith is advanced into an embrace; the recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bency on his Blood and Righteouſneſs is ſtronger; the ſubjection to his Royal Scepter is more full than it was; the reliance on Promiſes and compliance with Commands are both raiſed up to an higher pitch than they were before; at laſt Adherence comes to be Aſſurance. His Love grows; there comes to be an higher eſtimate ſet upon God, a cloſer union with him, a greater complacence in him than there was before. At laſt <hi>Love becomes a vehement flame, Cant.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Flamma Dei,</hi> the Flame of God, which burns up the earthly Affections, and aſpires after the full fruition of God in the Holy Heavens. Alſo, his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Patience are upon the increaſe: by much obeying, the Intention becomes more pure, the Will more free, the Obedience more eaſy and abundant; he doth not only do the Work of the Lord, but he
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:60626:215"/>abounds in it; he doth not only bring forth Fruit, but <hi>much Fruit, Joh.</hi> 15.8. By patient bearing of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the Art or Divine Myſtery of ſuffering comes to be underſtood; the Heart is yielded and reſigned up to the Divine pleaſure; he would be what God would have him be; he hath not only patience, but <hi>all patience, Col.</hi> 1.11. Patience hath not only a Work, but <hi>a perfect Work, Jam.</hi> 1.4. Thus in the Holy Man Grace is ſtill a growing.</p>
               <p>Further, The Holy Man grows every way; he grows inward; by exerciſing himſelf to Godlineſs his Vital Principles become more ſtrong, his Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat is increaſed; his inner Man is ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than ever it was before: he hath a Divine vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor to overcome corruptions, to repel temptations, to live above earthly things, to perform Heavenly duties, and to endure ſufferings.

The influences of Grace, and ſupplies of the Spirit make him to bring forth much fruit, and that with great variety; as occaſion ſerves, all the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Love, Joy, Peace, Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi> (which the Apoſtle mentions, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.) break forth from him in their ſpiritual Glory: <hi>He is like the Tree planted by the Rivers of Waters, Pſ.</hi> 1.3. which hath a fruit for every Seaſon; or like <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph's Fruitful bough by a Well, whoſe Branches run over the Wall, Gen.</hi> 49.22. There is a redundance and exuberancy of Holy Fruits, which ſhew that he hath a Divine Spirit, a Well of living Water in him ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:60626:216"/>up into all Obedience and good Works. He grows upward; by converſing in holy things, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earthed and unſelved; he converſes more than ever in Heaven; the Glory of God is more precious to him; his Intention towards it is more pure than it hath been; he waits and longs to be in that Bleſſed Region where God is all in all: Every Duty and Good Work looks up more directly than was uſual to God the great Center and End of all things: He grows downwards, I mean in Humility; by converſing with God he comes to have a greater Light than ever; which diſcovers the Majeſty and purity of God, the rectitude and Holineſs of the Law, the infirmity and reliques of Corruption in the lapſed Nature of Man; and this Diſcovery makes him very humble and vile in his own Eyes, even his very lapſes and falls ſerve occaſionally to this growth:<note place="margin">De Corr. &amp; Grat. c. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> Hence St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> treating on thoſe words, <hi>All things work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good to them that love God, Rom.</hi> 8. adds, <hi>Etiam ſi deviant &amp; exorbitant, hoc ipſum eis faciat proficere in bonum, quia humiliores redeunt &amp; doctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res;</hi> Experience tells him, that he is nothing, and Grace is all.</p>
               <p>Morever, the Holy Man never thinks that he hath Grace enough; never ſaith, I am perfect, or, I have attained;<note place="margin">Inceptio bonae vitae in quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis gradu ſine deſiderio aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi ad altiorem, non poteſt eſſe ſine fundamento praeſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptionis, nec ſine incluſione te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piditatis, nec ſine periculo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendi in vitiis ſpiritualibus. <hi>Niremb.</hi>
                  </note> this would ſhew him to be no Holy Man, to have no Grace at all. He is ſtill a breathing and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing after more Grace; the Divine touch, which in Converſion was made upon his Heart, cauſes it ever after to point towards God the Fountain of Grace: The ſweet taſte of Grace, which he hath had, makes him earneſtly thirſt after
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:60626:216"/>more; it's true, he has not a thirſt of total indigence; in this reſpect <hi>he ſhall never thirſt, John</hi> 4.14. but he hath a thirſt of Holy deſires after more Grace; his Soul pants after more of the Divine Image: Oh! that he were more like unto God! that his Will were ſwallowed up in the Divine Will! Nothing can ſatisfie him, unleſs he be made more Holy. He avoids thoſe things which hinder Spiritual growth; he will not lie in a ſink of ſenſual Pleaſures, he will not clog himſelf with a burden of earthly things, he will not fret away himſelf in Envy; he will not puff up himſelf with Pride and Preſumption; he will not wither away in an empty fruitleſs Profeſſion; he will not grieve the Holy Spirit of Grace, or willfully make any wounds in Conſcience. All theſe will be impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments to growth in Grace: therefore he puts them away from him; he buſies himſelf in thoſe things which may make him grow: he is much in prayer, that God would give the increaſe; that the ſhowres of Holy Ordinances may not drop and come down in vain; that the Gales of the Holy Spirit may fill every Ordinance, that the Sun-ſhine of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour may make every thing proſper: He knows that none can bleſs but he who inſtitutes; nothing can make rich in Grace but the Bleſſing; for that he waits in all his Devotions. He is much in the Holy Word; he hears, reads, meditates, digeſts it, lays it up as a Treaſure; keeps it as his Life; feeds on it as his Meat; hath his Being in it; and all that he may grow in Grace, that <hi>beholding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord, he may be changed into the ſame Image from Glory to Glory as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. That the Face of his Heart and Life may ſhine with a Divine Luſtre and Beauty: He acts his Faith
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:60626:217"/>upon Chriſt, he adheres and cleaves to him: He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires after more cloſe Union and Communion with him, that by a Divine Spirit and Life from him <hi>he may increaſe with the increaſe of God, Col.</hi> 2.19. that he may live like one in Union and Conjunction with Chriſt; that he may honour that Glorious Head, in whom the Spirit is above all meaſure, and from whom it flows down upon all his Members: He exerciſes himſelf unto Godlineſs; he ſtirs or blows up his Holy Graces: He repents, believes, loves, obeys, runs, ſtrives, labours to do the Will of God; and all that he may hold on his way, and grow <hi>ſtronger and ſtronger, Job</hi> 17.9. In a word, he eſteems it an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſhame and diſparagement to be barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful under the Goſpel. What? Is the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he partakes of, for nothing? every little living Creature propagates and brings forth its Image, and ſhall the Divine Nature have no progeny of good Works to reſemble its Father in Heaven? Are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances given in vain? the outward Rain hath its return in Herbs and Flowers, and excellent Fruits of the Earth; and ſhall the Showers of Ordinances, which come from an higher Heaven than the viſible one, have no return at all? to what purpoſe is Chriſt an Head to Believers? An Head is to communicate life and motion to the Members; and can the Members of ſo glorious an Head as he is, be dry and wither away in an empty unfruitfulneſs? Why is the Spirit communicated, but to profit withal? when it moved upon the Waters at firſt, it brought forth abundance of excellent Creatures in the Material World; and ſhall it it do nothing in the Spiritual one? or ſhall it produce Heavenly Principles in Men, and not bring them into act or exerciſe? Nothing can be more
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:60626:217"/>incongruous than ſuch things as theſe. The Holy Man therefore makes it his great buſineſs in the World, to grow in Grace and in the Knowledg of of Chriſt; to abound more and more in Obedience and Holy Walking, till he come to the Crown of Life and Righteouſneſs in Heaven.</p>
               <p>We ſee what an Holy Life is; nothing remains but that we labour after it; lapſed Nature lies too low to elevate it ſelf into Holy Principles and Actions; how ſhould we caſt down our ſelves at God's feet for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating Grace? How much doth it concern us to wait upon him in the uſe of means? to have our Minds enlightened to ſee Spiritual things? to have our Hearts new made and moulded into the Divine Will? to have a precious Faith to receive Chriſt in all his Offices? to have an Holy Love to inflame the Heart towards God? It is God's Prerogative to work ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Principles in us; let us then look up to him to have them wrought in us. We have loſt the Crown and Glory of our Creation; we are ſunk into an horrible gulf of ſin and miſery: but, Oh! let our Eyes be upon God; he can ſet to his Hand a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and create us again unto Good Works; he can let down an Arm of Power, and lift us up out of the pit of Corruption; nothing is too hard for him, he can turn our ſtony Heart into Fleſh; he can by an omnipotent Suavity make our unwilling Will to be a willing one. Oh! wait for this day of Power; and when it comes, give all the Glory to Free-grace, and live as becomes the Sons of God, who are born not of the Will of Man, but of God; it is too too much time we have ſpent in doing the Will of the Fleſh; let us now conſecrate and dedicate our ſelves to the Will of God. In the doing of it let's
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:60626:218"/>live a Life of Faith and dependance upon the influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Grace: let's get a ſingle Eye, a pure Intention towards the Will and Glory of God. What good we do, let's do it in an holy Compliance with his Will, in a ſincere ſubſerviency to his Glory. This is right genuine Obedience, in which God is owned as the firſt Principle, and the laſt End; if we depend not on him the Fountain of Grace, how ſhall we ſtand or walk in Holineſs? If we direct not all our good Works to his Will and Glory, how are our Works Holy or Conſecrated unto God? Let's put away our high thoughts and proud reflexes upon ſelf, that we may wholly depend upon his Grace. Let's caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all our Squints and corrupt aims from us, that we may directly look to his Will and Glory. Still let us remember, that the work of Mortification muſt be carried on; if we indulge ſin, we rent off our ſelves from God the chief Good and Ultimate End: if we conſecrate our ſelves to God, we muſt needs caſt away ſin from us; the Spirit and Fleſh are contrary Principles, and cannot rule together; the Works of the one and of the other cannot be compounded; the great Centers Heaven and Hell are at a vaſt diſtance, and cannot meet: We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore die to Sin, or elſe we cannot live to God; let us labour to be Holy in all manner of Converſation; let us go forth and meet God in every diſpenſation; in Ordinances let us meet him with Devotion and holy Affection; in Alms with Love and a free Spirit: in Proſperity with Praiſes and Good Works; in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity with Patience and Silence; in our Dealings with Juſtice and Righteouſneſs; in our Callings with Faithfulneſs and Diligence: In every thing let us walk <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, worthy of God; as becomes thoſe
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:60626:218"/>who are conſecrated unto him. Let us ſo exerciſe our ſelves unto Piety, that we may grow in all Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; that our Faith may be more lively, our Love more ardent, our Humility more low, our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs more high, our Obedience more full, our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience more perfect; that we may have our fruit unto Holineſs, and the End Everlaſting Life. Let us be ever making our ſelves ready for that Bleſſed Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; where there are plenitudes of Joy, Crowns of Immortality, Rivers of Pleaſures; where God is the Light, Life, Love, All in all to the Saints.</p>
